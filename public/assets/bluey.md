# "Magic Xylophone" (Season 1 Episode 1)
Mum!

Dad!

Bingo!

- Bluey!

Ladies and gentlemen,

I will now play for you\
the rondo "Alla Turca."

Hmm, hmm, hmm!

-Hey! Piano!

Ladies and gentlemen, I'm terribly sorry.

I seem to be having a little bit\
of trouble with my piano!

Dad! I want to be the piano.

No! It's still my turn.

Taking turns can be difficult.

Dad! She's had this many turns!

You can be the bum bongos!

-Bum bumda bum, bum bongos!

Bum bumda bum, bum bongos!

Bum bumda bum, bum bongos!

Bum bumda bum, bum bongos!

Bum, bumda, bum...

Ooh! Island rhythms!

Bum bumda bum, bum bongos!

This episode of Bluey\
is called The Magic Xylophone!

Where are the real bongos?

Bluey! Look!

Huh?

Oh, no! The--

Quick, Bingo! Get the dinger thing!

Let me up! Let me out of here!

Got it! Do a ding!

Freeze!

-Y--

Yeah! The Magic Xylophone!

Mum, come and look at this!

Oh, look!

It's just like when we first met.

Unfreeze!

-What?!

How did I get fingers up my nose?

Oh. The Magic Xylophone!

Give me that xylophone!

-Freeze!\
-Give me that --

Bingo, let's get the pens!

Oh, what a splendid mustache you have.

Ooh! Lovely.

It's my turn to unfreeze him.

Unfreeze!

-What?!

Arghh! You kids!

- Run!\
-Aaah!

-Give me the magic

xylophone!

-Gotcha!\
-Aaaah!

Yaha! Too slow, Mr Mustache!

Bluey, you're taking\
all the turns freezing.

Come on, Bingo. Let's get the teddies.

Okay.

I'm off to work!

Mum! Mum! Look at Dad now!

This loose hair's been\
bugging me all morning.

Okay, I'll unfreeze him.

I want to do it.

Mum, Bluey's not\
letting me have any turns.

Bluey, if you don't\
take turns with people,

people won't take turns with you.

But Bingo's too slow.

Dad will catch her.

No, I'm not.

You can either take turns

or I'll bring the xylophone\
to work with me.

I'll freeze my boss.

-No!\
-No!

Nnnn! Nnnn!

Well, you know what to do, then.

I'll see you later.

Just make sure you unfreeze him\
for toilet breaks, okay?

-Okay.\
-Okay.

-Here, Bingo.

But stand right back here.

That way, you could get a head start.

He runs really fast when he's mad.

Okay. Unfreeze!

-Ohh!

There you are!

-Grrr!\
-Run, Bingo!

Back inside!

Bingo! Bluey!

Come back here!

Where are they?!

I can't find them anywhere!

Oh, maybe they went downstairs.

I can't hear him.

I think we should freeze him,\
just in case.

Give me the xylophone.

No, I want to freeze him!

You've had all the freezing turns.

Bingo! Let go!

Freedom!

Got it!

You ding-dongs were too busy squabbling.

-Freeze!

-Aaaah!

-Freeze, freeze, freeze!

Oh, never mind. She'll keep.

Now, look at this lovely new garden gnome.

Ahh. This is the perfect spot.

Oh! Wait a minute!

It's got a little bit\
of felt pen on the fingers.

Probably from some mischief!

I'd better get the hose.

Nnn! Nnnnnnn!

Unfreeze me!

-Unfreeze!

Thanks, Bingo.

Dad's gone to get the hose.

-Let's go and hi--

Bluey, you always\
never take turns with me.

You just take all of the turns.

And it makes me feel sad.

I will unfreeze you if you promise

you will let me have turns, too.

Blink two times if "Yes."

♪ Gonna hose my dirty garden gnome ♪

♪ Gonna hose it good, unh ♪

Okay, time for a little bath,\
garden gnome!

Nnn! Nnnn!

Ohhhhh, yeah!

Huh?

-Freeze!

We tricked you!

Bingo unfroze me.

I was just pretending.

Now, Bingo!

Blub-blub-blub!

Here, Bingo. You can unfreeze him.

Thanks, Bluey.

Not just yet.

I like the Daddy water fountain.

# "Hospital" (Season 1 Episode 2)
Mum!

Dad!

Bingo!

Bluey!

Here comes the mountain climber!

-Is she gonna... ugh --\
-Eeeh!

...get to the top?

She made it!

I made it!

Uh-oh! It's getting windy!

-It's getting windy!\
-Go, Bingo!

Oh! She's fallen down!

-Again, again!

Do that to me!

Oh, man!

Is there some game\
where I just lie really still

on a comfy bed or something?

Hospitals!

Oh, not hospital.

This episode of Bluey\
is called Hospital.

Please lie here.

Thanks, Doctor.

No, I'm the nurse.

Oh, sorry. Thanks, nurse.

My name is Telemachus.

This remote control makes the bed

go up and down, Telemachus.

Oh, great.

This will make the legs go up.

-Boop pzhhh!\
-Aah!

Oops. Wrong button. Sorry, dear.

-Boop pzhh!\
-Ohh!

-Pzhhh!\
-Aah!

-Pzhhh!\
-Whoa!

Now, don't worry.

We're gonna make you feel all better.

Oh, good.

I'm actually a bit nervous at hospitals.

There's no need to be nervous.

-Hello!\
- Aah!

I'm the doctor.

Oh, hello, Doctor. My name is --

-Sting!\
-Ouch!

Oh, brave boy.

-What was that?!\
-A needle.

Now, what seems to be the matter?

Why did you give me a needle

before asking me what's the matter?

Because I'm very busy.

Now, what's up?

Well, my belly hurts.

Have you got a baby in there?

No, I don't think so.

Nurse, do an X-ray\
on the big blue guy, please.

I think there's a baby in there.

Yes, Doctor.

Hang on. I really don't think I have a --

-Sting!\
-Ouch!

-Bye!\
-Good grief!

She certainly likes those needles.

Don't worry, sweetie.

It's all to make you feel better.

Now, time for your X-ray.

Ready? Three, two, one.

X-ray!

X-ray will be ready in a jiffy!

Oh, good.

I'll just relax.

-I'm back! Sting!\
-Oww!

Bluey-- I mean, Doctor--

can that be the last injection, please?

Nope.

Here's the X-ray, Doctor.

Oh, thank you.

I'll just get this plaster off.

-Huh?\
-Rip!

Oww!

Brave boy.

Oh, well, this does not look good.

You see just here?

Oh, look. It's a... possum?

Yes. You have a possum in your belly.

That's not a possum. It's a cat!

Oh, yes, you have a cat in your belly.

How did it get in there?

-Did you eat one?\
-No!

Well, no one really knows\
how cats get in your belly,

but probably through your bellybutton.

What?! Really?

Yeah.

Probably, they just set up\
a slide while you're asleep

and just slide right in, you know?

My goodness.

We'll have to operate.

-Yes, Doctor!\
-Whoa. Hang on.

Let's do this!

-Here's a magazine to read.\
-Oh!

You mean you're not even\
gonna put me to sleep first?

Oh, yeah, I guess we could.

Nurse, can you put this\
big blue guy to sleep, please?

Yes, Doctor.

♪ Go to sleep ♪

♪ Go to sleep ♪

♪ Go to sleepy, big Telemachus ♪

-He's asleep!

Oh, good. I can give him another needle.

Sting!

Oww! Bluey!

You're meant to be asleep!

No... more... needles!

Fine!

♪ Go to sleep ♪

♪ Go to sleep ♪

He's asleep!

Okay, let's go!

-Aroo-roo-roo-roo!\
-Ooh! Ooh!

Ah ha ha! Aroooo!

Now, let's get this cat out!

-Oh, I think I got it!

-Here, kitty!

Aah!

Aah! That's not a cat!

That's an octopus!

Put him back in!

I think it's supposed to be in there!

-Get back in, octopus!

So many tentacles!

Doctor, catch!

-Get... back...i n!

Ohh!

Aah! Bingo!

It's got the remote!

-Let go!\
-Whoaaa!

Hey!

Let go!

Hey! I see the cat!

I see the cat!

Nurse, give me something to whack it with.

Okay.

-Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! Ooh!

Ooh! Ooh!

Ooh, I got his tail!

Pull it!

-Aaaaah!

What happened?

It bit me!

Oh, you poor dear.

That cat's not going anywhere!

Oh, my!

Better wake the big blue guy and tell him.

You mean we can't make him\
feel all better?

Nope. Wake up, mate!

-Oww! Bluey!

Doctor Bluey.

Is the operation finished?

Yeah, sorry. There's nothing we can do.

That cat just won't come out.

Oh. I see.

Now, I've got other patients.

You're on your own.

What?!

See ya!

Aww. I thought I was\
gonna feel all better.

I'm sorry.

That's okay. You tried your best.

Hmm.

Leave it with me.

Okay, nurse.

Hmm. Yes.

Those prickles will\
have to come out, I'm afraid.

Excuse me, Doctor.

I'm very busy, nurse.

I know, but can you look\
at this X-ray again?

If it's from the big blue guy,

there's really nothing I can do.

Just check it a bit closer.

Fine!

Wait a minute!

I didn't see this before.

Hello, big blue guy.

His name's Telemachus.

Something else has turned up\
on your X-ray, Telemachus.

-Really?\
-Look-- here.

Oh.

It's a... pot plant?

No! It's a mouse!

Ah. Of course-- a mouse.

I think you swallowed a mouse!

And then the cat ran in after it.

Because cats chase mice!

Oh, goodness!

What are you gonna do?

Hmmmmm.

What if we lured the mouse out...

With some cheese?

Then the cat would chase the mouse...

Right out of my belly!

-Yeah!\
-Yeah!

Little bit lower!

Little bit lower!

There's the mouse!

Rowr!

And there's the cat!

-Hooray!\
-Hooray!

Oh, good kitty.

How do you feel?

Hmm.

I feel all better!

-Hooray!\
-Hooray!

Thanks, Doctor.

And thank you, nurse.

You're welcome.

Well, if that's that,\
then I guess I'll be on my way.

-Oh, one more thing.\
-What's that?

Sting!

Who is responsible\
for this mess?

My, my, all these toys\

We know!

Can you imagine how easy\

if you'd tidied them all away?

That isn't helping!

Ahh! So relaxing.

Yeah, this is how we should always do it.

Yeah.

Actually, Daddy Robot,

we never want to tidy\

Yeah, ever again.

Never again?

Never again.

Ever. At all.

You understand?

Yes, Master. Brrrt boop boop.

Recalculating objectives.

Brrrt boop boop boop.

Daddy Robot?

Following Master's orders. Brrrt brrrp.

Aah! Put us down!

[laughing] I love Daddy Robot.

Where are you taking us?!

Brrrp. To the wheelie bin.

What?! Why?!

You two are the reason\
playroom is always untidy.

If I throw you in wheelie bin,\
playroom will always be tidy,

and then you will never have to\
tidy playroom ever again.

-What?!\
-What?!

It's a solid plan, Master.

[kids scream]

[Bluey] Mum!

Daddy Robot is gonna\
throw us in the wheelie bin!

Oh, no!

Come here, vacuum cleaner.

Aah!

Yeah, Daddy Robot,\
she's not a vacuum cleaner.

Oh, yes. Brrt brrt. My mistake.

This is not a vacuum cleaner.

I told you!

-It's a banjo!\
-What?!

Hey, that's my sister, not a banjo!

Brrt brrp. What are you doing\

Fold, fold, fold, fold, fold!

Oh, no. A Guinea pig has escaped.

What?!

Aah!

Mum! Daddy Robot thinks I'm a guinea pig!

What should I do?!

Ya! Ya! Ya! Ya!

Come back here, guinea pig.

You have to push his nose to turn him off!

But how?

I know! I've got an idea!

Brrbraa! Brrbraa! Brrbaa!

La la!

Look, Daddy Robot.

Bzzt!

It's a Mummy Robot.

All right, now! Turn him off!

These circuits are badly damaged.

-Aww.\
-Ha!

It's strange, though.

Daddy Robots don't usually\
go crazy like that.

Well, actually, it's our fault.

We ordered Daddy Robot\
to tidy the playroom for us.

And that's when he tried to\
throw you in the wheelie bin?

Yeah.

Oh, I see.

Okay. I'll tell you a secret.

Daddy Robots will always find\
the easiest way to do a job.

-Oh!\
-Oh!

Just... like...

[Bingo echoing] I hope he's okay.

[Dad] Boooeeee!

Hello, Daddy Robot.

How are you feeling?

Doo-doo-doo-doo- doo-doo!

I dreamt I met a robot angel.

Zzt!

Hello, Master. What are my orders?

Brrrp!

Follow us.

Bip bip bip bip brrt brrp.

Now sit down.

Zzt! Yes, Master?

Now lie back.

Zzt! Are you sure, Master?

Zzt! Shouldn't I tidy\
something up for you?

-No.\
-No.

We order you to relax, Daddy Robot.

Bzzt! Zzt! Zzzt!

-Zzzt! Zzzt!\
-[giggles]

I've never relaxed before.

Is this right?

Usually, you close your eyes.

Brrr...

brrrt!

Look who's here!

[robot voice] Brrrt! Hello again.

Boop boop rrrrrr!

Cheese and crackers.

Beeboop boop boop boop. Zzzt! Zzzt.

You robots relax.

We're gonna tidy the playroom.

Come on, Bingo.

Oh, sorry, Bluey.\
I'll try and stop.

What if we play\
Shadowlands instead?

Yeah!

This episode of Bluey\
is called Shadowlands.

What's Shadowlands?

It's fun.

All the shadowy, grassy bits\
are the land,

and all the bits in the sun\
is the sea.

Yeah, and there's crocodiles\
in the sea.

Yeah,\
you can't touch the water,

or you get bitten\
by a crocodile.

So you can only walk\
on the land?

These bits?

Yeah, and we have to getnfrom here\
to the picnic blanket.

All right!

But you can't just\
change the rules

to make it easy this time,\
okay?

No, I won't.

You promise?

I promise.

Okay, let's go!

-Yeah!\
-Yeah!

Whoo!

This is fun!

I told you.

You won't get us, crocodile.

Ooh! I can't jump that far.

Look at my little legs.

Well, maybe just this time,

you can have\
crocodile-proof shoes.

Coco!

Oh. Yeah. Sorry.

But how is Snickers\
gonna get over?

Umm...

I know!

Come here, Coco!

Now get on my shoulders.

Go, Snickers!

Yeah! We did it!

Great idea, Bluey!

Hey, this bug\
looks like bird poo.

Bluey, look out!

Bluey!

Bluey!

Aaaaah!

You're trapped.

How are you gonna\
get across the river?

I don't know.

How about we just pretend\
in this bit,

all the crocodiles are asleep?

You can't\
change the rules, Coco!

Ohh! Why not?

Because they're the rules!

Look! A bus!

Are you ready, Bluey?

I'm ready!

Go!

Aaaaah!

Go, Bluey!

Eeee-yaaaah!

Yeah!

That was so cool!

Come on!

We're almost\
at the picnic blanket!

Be careful, everyone.

This bridge is really skinny.

Wait!

-It's getting windy!

The wind's making it move!

I can't stay on!

Aaaaah!

The crocodiles\
are gonna get us!

What are we gonna do?!

Run!

Phew! We made it!

But look.

There's no way\
to get across the sea!

And we can't go back this way.

We're trapped\
on a palm tree island!

Oh, noooo!

The little critters\
must be hungry.

Oh, I brought something\
for them.

Cupcakes!

Who wants cupcakes?

Cupcakes!

They've got blue icing!

And sprinkles!

Sprinkles!

Why don't we just make it\
so we can...

walk on water?

No one can walk on water.

Water boatmen can.

Well, we aren't water boatmen.

We need to find another way.

I'm going to eat your cupcakes!

No!

That's it!

I'm gonna be a water boatman\
and walk across this water

and have a cupcake.

No, Coco!

-Arr-oooh!

But I want a cupcake!

You can't just\
change the rules!

But you still haven't\
told me why!

Well, because...

I don't know!

See? There's no reason.

Maybe Coco's right, Bluey.

Maybe we can just change\
the rules an eensy bit?

It'll still be Shadowlands.

Okay.

Wait!

What is it?

The wind is back.

Look!

It's blowing the cloud.

It's heading towards the sun.

Run!

Quick!

Hurry up, Snickers!

Run your little\
sausage dog legs!

I can't run any faster!

Oof!

The crocodiles are coming!

Aaaaaaah!

We did it!

That was so much fun!

Yeah!

That's why you can't\
change the rules--

because the rules make it fun!

Oh, yeah!

Kids and cupcakes, eh?

A cupcake for each hand,\
Snickers?

You got it made in the shade.

What's the time,\
Mrs. Wolf?!

Three o'clock!

One, two, three!

What's the time, Mrs. Wolf?!

Um...

Maybe this one\
will be dinnertime.

It won't.

Coco always waits until\
we're right up next to her

before she says--

Dinnertime!

Don't let him get up!

-You're not getting up, ever!\
-Stay on him!

You're not going anywhere,\
you wild beast!

I'm just going for a run!\
I'll see you later.

-Bye Mum!\
-See ya, Mum!

-Let me up!\
-No, you're not getting up!

I've got to give\
your mum a kiss.

-Ooh!\
-No smoochy kiss for you.

Oh, no!

Hang on, hang on! Shh, shh!

Boyd is out,\
the first ball after...

Okay, I've --I've\
actually got to watch this.

-Noooo! Get his legs, Bingo!\
-Ahh! Come on!

I just want to see this wicket.

Hey Bingo, you wanna\
play statues?

Yeah!

How is that LBW?

-Dad!\
- Coming!

Dad! Yeah, I'm coming!

-Daaad!\
-Okay, okay.

Bonjour!

Oh, hello. Would you like\
to buy a statue?

Ah, yes, I definitely\
would like to buy a statue.

I-- Wait a minute.

These aren't\
magic statues, are they?

Oh, no, these aren't magic.

These are just normal statues.

Oh, good, 'cause I've been\
down that road before.

Whoop, pause the game. Beep!

♪ Bilby's digging\
Bilby's digging ♪

♪ Cockatoo, cockatoo ♪

Phoar, it stinks!

Well, you're welcome\
to wait outside, kiddo.

Boop! Unpause.

Okay, I'd like that one, please.

Four hundred dollareedoos.

Thank you.

Enjoy your statuuue!

Now, where am I gonna\
put this statue?

Ah, yes, just here.

Oh, I forgot my change.

Hi.

I think I forgot my change.

-Oh, yes, sir. Here you go.

Thank you, shopkeeper.

I'll just get back\
to my statue,

which I'm sure\
is right over here.

-What?!

What's it doing over here?!

I could have sworn\
I left it over there.

Oh, well. I guess\
I'll just put it back.

Is everything okay?

I think so.

I could have sworn I left\
the statue here,

but I found it over there.

Well, you're probably just\
going crazy or something.

Oh, yes, probably.

Huh?

What's going on here?

Where's my statue?!

Hey, how did you get out here?

There's definitely\
something weird going on.

Pbhhht!

What? Grrr!

This is a magic statue!\
I knew it!

You sold me a magic statue!

-You get back here!

Grrrrr!

Where are you,\
you little reprobates?

Oh, someone's at the door.

Hello!

Oh. What?

-That's strange.

-I thought someone rang the doorbell.

Oh, well, I'll just\
go back inside

and carry on\
with my current tasks.

Hello?

Huh? What?

Well, that's twice now,\
and there's no one here.

Certainly a very\
strange occurrence.

I want to do it.

Okay. I'll help you.

Ungh!

Almost!

-Ahh!

-Hello! Yarr!

-It was you kids all along!

-Where's my 400 dollareedoos?!

- Run, Bingo!

- Heel! Heel!\
-Huh?

Is that a leaf?

Are you a leaf?

You look like a leaf,

but you're walking.

Are you a walking leaf?

But I don't understand.

Why would a leaf want to walk?

You should be in a tree, leaf.

Daddy, come and see!

Where are you going,\
walking leaf?

Come here, Daddy! Quickly!

-Give me back my dollareedoos!

Daddy, come and see.

Oh!

Goodbye.

Have fun.

I'll miss you.

-Mum!\
-Where's my Bluey?

-Well, go on.

Give your Mum a hug.\
What are you waiting for?

Oh, Dad!

Oh! Sorry.

Where's your sister?

There she is.

Ahhhh.

Is there more weekend tomorrow?

There sure is.

Hooray!

Night, sweetie.

Already tucked in, Bingo,\
you little star?

-Oh, what's up?

- Psst, honey!

-Come up here.\
-Yep, coming.

Oh, and she's got sushi shoes,

and there's rice at the bottom

to help the shoes stand up.

-Hey, Bingo.

Daddy, you didn't come\
and see the walking leaf.

Ah, I'm sorry.

I didn't hear you.

That's okay.

The thing is, I don't know\
if you know this,

but I bought this statue today\
from a shop,

and it turned out to be magic.

Yeah, every time\
he would put it somewhere,

it would just\
keep running away.

Yeah, and then I went\
to see the shopkeeper

and tried to get my money back,\
but she kept running away.

And he chased me\
all around the yard.

I kept running away.

Yeah, and I didn't even get\
my 400 dollareedoos back.

So I'm sorry.

-Daddy?\
-Yeah?

-It was me!\
-What?

I was the statue!

-What?!

You know what?

I did think you looked\
a little bit familiar.

-Night.\
-Night, Bingo.

Night night, Bingo.

-Daddy?\
-Yes, mate?

Just leaves the door\
open this much,

so the leaf can come in.

No worries, kiddo.

You've got to.

And they're blowing the whistle,

the farmer's yelling,

"It's dog versus sheep!"

Oh, wow!

Don't you hate that dog shampoo?

But it does get the ticks.

[soft music playing]

There. Table's set.

Almost ready with the sausages, kids!

I love sausages!

Ruff, ruff, rowwrrr!

This is my relaxer chair.

It's where I relax.

Ahh! So relaxing.

Tell me about it.

Bandit had one on the back\
of his ear the other day.

He kept going, "Ooh! Ooh!"

[panting]

We have to have salad with our barbecue!

You're right, Muffin!

Bingo, can you be in charge of the salads?

Well, I was relaxing\
in my relaxing chair, but okay.

Ooh, that sun is hot.

-Can I borrow this, Dad?\
-Hey!

Okay, this is the salad bowl.

Ahhhh!

You need to put salad in it!

R-R-R-Rowwrrr!

I like pepper salad!

Ooh, me too. I love peppers.

Rowrr, rowrr! Gleen pepper!

Yellow's my favorite color pepper.

[sighs]

Hmm, yellow pepper.

[squeals, giggles]

Eh!

Unh!

Almost.

He doesn't listen to the farmer.

He goes straight for the sheep.

-Oh, no way!\
-Just borrowing this, Dad!

Gets five of them. They're up over.

They're in the truck.

-Hey!\
-[laughs]

[strained] Unh, it's so heavy!

-Aah, aah, Mum!

Hmm.

Ooh!

Unh!

And then --hey!

[laughs]

Bingo!

Got it!

Sorry, Dad!

Here you go-- yellow pepper.

Ruff! Rowrr!

Now I'm gonna relax.

Ahhh!

My favorite color pepper is red pepper.

Red pepper? [groans]

There's no red plants\
around, though, Muffin.

Yes, there is-- in that tree.

Oh, yeah! The Poinciana.

[squealing]

Aah! Aah!

Aaaah!

Red pepper!

I mean-- Oh!

[laughs]

Bingo, what are you doing?

[Bingo] I'm making a salad!

Okay!

[breathing heavily] Yaah!

Yeah!

[panting] There!

-Red pepper.\
-Yeah!

I don't think there's\
any more colors of pepper.

[weakly] So now... I'm only...

I'm just gonna...

relax in my... relaxer chair.

[sighs heavily]

Ooh, I like that salad dressing, Chilli.

Yeah, thanks. I made it myself.

It's Aunty Mary's recipe.

We need salad dressing!

Oooowwrrr!

Ahhh, okay.

-So, what'd you do?\
-Well --

Can I borrow this, Dad?

-Hey!\
-[laughs]

Mud. All mine.

Oh, we're out of mud.

I will make some more.

[grunts]

Dad, which way do I turn on the hose?!

Urghh! Dad!

Yes, Bingo!

-Oh! [gargles]\
-[laughs]

Don't worry! I got it working!

There. Now I'll fill up my jar.

I'll just put this down here.

[screams]

-[laughter]\
-It's raining.

Bingo, what are you doing down there?!

Bingo, grab the hose!

I'm trying! Aaaah!

[laughs] It's tickling my bottom!

-Forget the hose!\
-[laughing]

Turn off the tap!

-[tap squeaks]\
-[Dad] No, no, no!

The other way. Right to tight!

Got it!

-[all] Yeah!\
-[Socks] Awoooo!

My goodness!

This is not relaxing.

Salad dressing!

Now, I'm going to sit\
in my relaxer chair and relax!

Hmph!

[Mum] Whose muddy footprints are these?!

[mop squeaks]

More sausages, please, Bluey.

Phew! Finally, I get to relax!

Ahhhh!

Sausages are ready!

-[Socks] Awooo!

Ohhh!

Out of the way, salads.

-Ohh, looks good, Bandit!\
-Ooh!

Well done. They look delicious, Bandit.

Why, thank you. Thank you very much.

Isn't anyone going to mention the salads?!

[all cheering]

Check it out, kids.\
Look how good they look.

# "Fruitbat" (Season 1 Episode 8)
Mum!

Dad!

Bingo!

- Bluey!

-Ehh... easy.

Ohh! Ohh!

Bluey, easy!

- Aah! Aah!

-Oh, not fair!

-How good's Pop Up Croc?\
-Again!

No. Upstairs for bedtime.

Nooooooo!

Oh, here we go.

Noooooo!

-Ooh!\
-Ooh!

This episode of Bluey\
is called Fruit Bat.

All right, say goodnight to the animals.

Goodnight, frogs.

Night, kangaroos,

Night, bilbies.

Night, fruit bats.

No, not "Night, fruit bats."

They don't sleep at night.

They're octurnal.

Good knowledge, kid.

You mean fruit bats don't need\
to go to bed now?

No. But you do.

Come on. Bedtime.

I wish I was a fruit bat.

Well, fruit bats don't get\
to do rocket ship.

Yeah! Rocket ship!

Okay, helmets.

Choo-choog.

Seatbelts!

-Click!\
-Click!

Close the door.

-Clunk.\
-Click.

Okay, push the button!

-Boop!\
-Boop!

-Yeah!\
-Yeah!

Okay, shower time.

No! More rocket ship!

I don't need a shower.

Yeah, you do, ya grub.

Poahh!

Not fair!

I bet fruit bats\
don't have to have showers.

Well, then they wouldn't\
get to play penguins.

Yeah, penguins!

Whee!

Teeth time.

Mum, look, I'm a penguin!

Whee!

Oh, wackadu!

Even though I don't\
really need to do a wee,

I'm going to do one anyway.

Otherwise, I might wet the bed.

-That's very clever, Bingo.

It's called a tactical wee.

-Not fair.

I want to stay up like a fruit bat.

Well, when the fruit bats\
go to the toilet,

they do it hanging upside down,

so the wee just runs all over them.

-Blegh!\
- Bleaghh!

I'd love that!

I bet you would, you little grub!

Whee! Whee!

Come on. That's a daytime game.

Oh, I just want to be a fruit bat.

Yeah, yeah. I know.

But fruit bats don't get\
to play the story game,

where I tell a story,\
but pretend to fall asleep.

-Yeah!\
-Ah!

"So, the little puppy peeked\
in the window,

and on the table was the most beautiful--"

-Wake up!\
-Wake up!

Huh? What? What? Oh, sorry.

I think I must have just dozed off.

Now, where was I?

Oh, yeah.

"...the most beautiful\
golden egg she'd ever seen.

So she climbed inside,

but out jumped a huge hairy--"

-Wake up!\
-Wake up!

Aah! Aah! Spider!

Aw! I'm not tired.

I know. Just try, okay?

It's not fair!

Night, Bluey.

Ugh!

Ohh!

I can't fall asleep!

Psst! Bingo, are you awake?

Hmph!

Bluey.

What am I gonna do with you, hey?

Let me stay up?

Ehhh.

What's Dad doing?

Hmm, I'd say he's dreaming

about playing touch football\
with his mates.

Really?

Yeah, he doesn't get to play\
that much anymore,

so he keeps having dreams about it.

Why doesn't he get to play it\
for real life?

Well, he's busy, sweetheart.

Busy working and looking after you two.

Oh.

Oh look! Did he just score a try?

I think he did.

Ooh, maybe I can dream\
about being a fruit bat.

Well, you could give it a go.

Night, Mum!

Oh, okay.

Night, honey.

Come on!

Come on!

Dream about being a fruit bat!

It didn't work.

Oh, well, you tried.

Where'd Dad go?

He's outside.

Dad!

Dad!

Daaad!

Hey, Dad!

Hey, Bluey!

You're a fruit bat!

Yeah!

How is it?

It's great!

You get to eat a lot of fruit!

Ha! I bet.

Hey, did you see my try?

Yeah, I did!

How good was it?!

So good.

There's plenty more where that came from!

- Yeah, ya reckon?\
-Yeah, sure.

Yeah, I do.

Oh, righto!

All right, see ya, Bluey.

Come on, let's do this!

See ya, Dad!

Wow!

Hi.

Seven o'clock!

That was a big sleep.

I had the most amazing dream.

One, two, three, four...

-Dad?\
-...five, six...

Yes, mate? ...seven...

Thanks for looking after us.

...eight, nine, ten!

You're welcome.

I've got your favorite, Bluey--

fruit salad!

Yuck!

No more fruit.

Just some toast, please.

Mm-mm-mnh. 

# "Horsey Ride" (Season 1 Episode 9)
Mum!

Dad!

Bingo!

- Bluey!

Today, Polly, the cousins\
are coming over.

Mum and Aunt Trixie\
are gonna play hockey.

That means we can play horsey\
with Dad and Uncle Stripe.

Is that gonna be fun?

Yeah, I think so.

Ohh, good Polly Puppy.

- Bluey!

They're here!

Bluey, last time\
the cousins visited,

you got upset because they\
spilled passion fruit

all over Polly Puppy.

Oh, yeah,\
I better put her away.

'Cause she's\
your special puppy.

Yes! I'll put her in my room.

Oh, there's my watermelon!

Aah!

Nom nom nom nom!

Gidday, Bingo.\
Gidday, Bluey.

Hello, Bandit.

-Hi.\
-Hi.

Hey kids, how're ya goin'?

-Hey, brother.\
-Hey.

your thongs, Muffin.

Aunt Chilli,\
I'm wearing thongs!

Oh, great!

Hello, Socks.

-Ooh!

Arghhhh!

Okay kids, Aunt Trix and I\
are off to play hockey.

Have fun with Dad\
and Uncle Stripe.

See ya, kids.

Quick,\
let's get out of here.

-Bye!\
-Bye!

See ya later!

All right, girls,

who wants\
to sit on the couch

and watch cricket?!

Noooo!

-Not me!\
-Not me!

No way.

Let's play\
horsey ride!

Yeah!

-Ahhh.

Well, we gave it\
a shot.

This episode of Bluey\
is called Horsey Ride.

Giddyup, Sparkles!

Neigh!

Giddyup,\
Gallahop!

-Neigh! Prrrrt!

-Neigh!\
-Brrrr!

Come on, horsies.\
Giddyup!

-Brrr!\
-Brrr!

When I do this,\
it means giddyup!

-Giddyup!\
-Giddyup!

-Oh! Ahh!\
-Ahh! Ohh!

-Brrr!\
-Brrr!

Horsies love tiles.

Sparkles needs\
more sparkles on her.

Ooh, I'll get\
some glitter.

-Neigh!\
-Brrrr!

Aaaah!\
Polly Puppy!

Brrr!

Daaaad!

-Let go, Socks!

Hey, hey. Okay,\
chill the beans, everyone.

Socks won't let go\
of Polly Puppy!

Socks, let Polly go.

It's Bluey's special toy.

Let me try.

Hey there, Rocksocks,\
how about we --

-Ow!

Well, I'm out of ideas.

I put all my special toys away\
when my cousins come over.

You should have done that, Bluey.

Good idea, Muffin.

I was going to do that,

but then you ate me\
like a watermelon,

and I got distracted.

No point playing\
the blame game.

We need a solution.

Something for Socks that's\
even more fun than Polly Puppy.

What about\
a horsey ride?

Or two horsey rides?

What if we had a horsey wedding?

Yee!

Sparkles can marry Gallahop!

Huh?

And we could make confetti.

-What?\
-And invite Socks!

-What was that?\
-Yeah!

Oh, man.

-Socks!

We'd like to invite you

to the wedding\
of Sparkles and Gallahop!

-Huh?

Hmm.\
Bring out Sparkles!

I'm the luckiest horse\
in the world.

Horsies can't talk.

Ladies and gentlemen,

may Sparkles marry\
Gallahop today.

Socks! The wedding\
has started!

It's not working.

-Get them to say some things.

You may now\
say some things.

Uh...

I'm not marrying him.\
He stinks.

My heart is breaking.

I said, horsies can't talk!

Oh, I mean...

Let them get married!

You may now get married.

Neigh!

She said, you now get married!

You have to say "I do."

Yeah, but in horsey talk.

Brrr!

-Neighhh!

Sparkles!

No!

Come back,\
Sparkles!

You have to do it properly!

Neigh! Ooh!

-Brrr! Brrrr!

Come back, Sparkles!

Marry Gallahop!

Now!

Brrr!

I want Polly back.

Prrrrt!

Where'd he go?

He's watching the cricket!

Get him!

Brrr! Brrr!

Neighhhh!

Neigh! Neigh!

Yeah!

Good one, Socks!

Aroooo!

I'd been\
looking forward to this day

all my life,

and now it's ruined.

Neigh.

Prrrrt.

You may now say "I do."

Well, I guess that's why\
we wear mouth guards.

Well, that sounds positive.

What have you kids\
been up to?

Ah, you know, just regular\
childhood games.

Uncle Stripe married Dad!

Yeah!

Oh, really?

-Arooooo!

Well, who could blame him?

# "Hotel" (Season 1 Episode 10)
Mum!

Dad!

Bingo!

- Bluey!

Shhh!

Bandit, I'm just having\
a quick shower,

then I'll give you\
a hand cleaning the room.

All good, I got it covered.

-Now, where are those naughty kids?

- Yeah!\
-Yahh!

Oh, whoa, here they are.

Do that again!

Kids, no kids.

Kids, no kids.

Kids, no kids.

-Let's play Hotels!\
-Yeah!

Oh, no, not Hotels.

This episode of Bluey\
is called Hotel.

Oh, Bingo,\
we have a guest.

I want to be\
a crazy pillow!

No, you're\
the crazy hotel helper.

-Aww.\
-Hello.

No, Dad, you have\
to push the bell.

Oh, okay.

-Diiiing!\
-Aaah!

I might just fix\
that bell's volume.

There.\
Let's try again.

-Ding!\
-That's better.

Hello, how are you?

-We are very nice.\
-I'm good.

I'd like a room,\
please.

Oh, yes,\
we have some rooms.

One with a TV.

Oh, yes, sure.

This way, please.

Thank you!

Bingo, grab his suitcase.

No, my name is Slobberdobba.

Oh, yes, grab his suitcase,\
Slobberdobba.

I have an important cleaning job\
to do in the morning,

so it's very important\
that I am not disturbed.

Oh, of course.

We have this lovely room.

It has the sleepy bunny\
night-light

and some toys.

Hmm, no thanks.

We also have this room.

Hmm, maybe too many computers\
and not enough beds.

And we have this room.

Hey!\
Do you mind?

-Oh, no, too stinky.

And this is the big room.

It has a bed and a TV.

Oh, and there's a lady in the shower.

Is that okay?

This will do nicely.

Goodnight!

Hmm, this pillow\
isn't very comfy.

-Yes, it is.\
-Oh, okay.

-Yarp! Yarp! Yarp!

Crazy helper!

Okay, see you\
in the morning, sir.

Yes, please see that I am\
not disturbed until then.

Oh, of course.

My helper won't be crazy at all.

Oh, I'm sure she won't.

Yaaaarp!

Me tidy room now!

-What?\
-Yarp yarp yarp yaaarp!

-Oh, Slobberdobba!\
-Yarp yarp yarp yarp!

-I'm terribly sorry about this, sir.\
-Yarp yarp yaaarp! Yaaarp!

-Yarp yarp yarp! Yarp yarp yarp!\
-Well, I should say so.

I have a very important meeting\
in the morning.

Yarp yarp yarp yarp yarp!

Do you need a crazy pillow?

No, he doesn't.

-Yarp yarp yarp yarp yaaaarp!\
-This is very embarrassing.

It won't happen again.

Well, please see that it doesn't.

-Breakfast time!\
- Huh? Wha--What?

Breakfast time!

Who wants bacon?

But it's the middle\
of the night!

Who wants\
night bacon?

Slobberdobba!

I'm so sorry, sir.

This won't happen again.

Shapoorr!

Well, night bacon does sound\
pretty good, actually.

As long as I'm up,\
I might as well watch the news.

Yeah, the news!

Bluey, can I be crazy pillow now?

Come on, Bingo.

Ugh!

Try the TV again!

Okay.\
Click!

Oh, hello.

I am the TV.

Today on the news --

A wild storm kept banging\
people's heads into the bed!

-Ooh! Ooh! Ooh!

-Cartoons are on!

Now, back to the news.

We have thunder!

-Oooh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh!

Oh-oh-oh!\
Oh! Oh! Oh! Ohh!

Bluey, I want to be\
a crazy pillow.

No, you're the news.

-Arghh!\
-And lightning!

Brrrr-pow!

No, I'm not playing.

You're bossing me around.

Slobberdobba, come back this instant!

Ah, TV.

Always people\
shouting at each other.

Click!

Alright, kid, I gotta get back\
to making the bed.

No, Dad, wait.\
Don't stop.

You have to keep playing.

We've not finished Hotels.

Well, you better sort it out\
with Bingo, kiddo.

You have to let her make\
some decisions, too, you know.

Okay.

Don't start tidying.

Please, Bingo,\
you have to keep playing

or Dad will stop playing.

I don't wanna play anymore.

Please?

No!

Please!

No!

Please, Bingo,\
I'll do anything.

No!

Okay.

Alright, I'll play.

-Really?\
-Yeah!

But I wanna be\
a crazy pillow.

Okay.

Yeah!

Crazy pillow!

Hello, sir.

I have a new pillow here for you.

Oh, thank you.

Don't worry.\
It's not a crazy pillow.

-Well, that's a plus.

My, oh, my,\
this is very comfortable

and not wriggly at all.

Okay, well, I best\
go to sleep now.

Night.

Agh! Tickly nose.

Hmm, that's odd.

Hey! Pillow!

-Get back here!

Now, stay there, pillow.

And where's\
my blanket?

-Ah, there it is!

Ah, that's better.

Tickle him!

Hey, wait a minute!

Hey, this is a crazy pillow!

Yeah!

I'm a crazy blanket!

Aaah! Runaway bed stuff!

Stop!\
I'll catch you with my net!

I'm coming to get you!

Stop!

I thought you were gonna\
clean the room.

# "Bike" (Season 1 Episode 11)
Mum!

Dad!

Bingo!

- Bluey!

You sure you don't want some help?

No.

So close!

This episode of Bluey\
is called Bike.

Humph!\
It's not fair!

Why can't I just\
do it straightaway?

That's not how the world works, kid.

Then the world is silly!

Can't argue with that.

I'm never riding that bike again!

Okay.

Ooh.

Ooh!

Eee!

Oh. The button is unpressing.

Almost.

Ohhhh!

Oh, poor Bingo.

She'll figure it out.

Hey, look at Bentley!

I can't reach!

Oh. She can't reach the monkey bars.

Ooooh!

Aww!

Hey, look at your cousin Muffin.

Finished my water!

Put it in my backpack!

Put my backpack on my back!

One arm through.

Now the other one.

Come here, strap!

She can't get the bag on.

Oh, Muffin,\
the strap's just there!

Just stick your arm through.

Look, Bingo's having another go.

Go, Bingo! Faster!

Come on, Bingo!

Come on, Bingo.

Come on, Bingo!

Oh!

Almost!

Oof!

That's it!

Oh, she's gonna try to jump.

Okay, here she goes.

Yay! Jumping!

Ohhhhh!

Ow!

She's okay.

Whoa!\
Look at Muffin!

Waaa-aaa-aaa-aaa-aaa-aah!

Ah, don't spin 'round, Muffin!

Daddle-daddle-daddle-daddle!

Ooh!

-Ah, she's dizzy!

Ha ha!

Whoooa!

-Oh!\
-Ooh!

Oh, boy.\
Here comes the meltdown.

Waaaaah!

This is unacceptable!

Why won't you\
go on my back, you bag?!

Whoa!\
Look at Bentley!

Here she goes.

Jumping!

-Oh! So close!\
-Aww!

Why can't I do it straightaway?!

Hey!\
That's what I said!

Oww!

Aww.

I can't do it.

I'll never be able\
to drink water again.

And then I curled\
into a little ball, too.

Poor Bingo.

I'll go and hold the button for her.

Hang on.\
Not so fast.

Let's just see\
what happens next.

What's she doing?

Oooh!

What?!

Wait a minute.

She's got an idea!

Muffin's going for it.

Come on, Muffin!

You can do it, Muffin!

Go, Muffin!

Look at Bentley!

Go, Bentley!

Go, Bentley!

Look at the focus!

She's gonna do it.

She's gonna do it!

Go, Bentley!\
You can do it!

Yes!

Go, Muffin!

Yeah!

Got it!

-Yeah!\
-Yeah!

Good one, Muffin.

Yeah, good one, Muffin!

Yeah!

Almost.

Yep! Got it!

Yeah!

Go, Bentley!

Yes!

You beauty!

That was great!

I'd like to get down now.

Whoo!

How's Bingo doing?

-Oh! Bingo!\
-Oh, Bingo!

That's disgusting!

That's less than ideal.

But it's still a win.

Nice work, Bingo!

Nice work, Bluey.

# "Bob Bilby" (Season 1 Episode 12)
Mum!

Dad!

Bingo!

- Bluey!

Please come in.

Oh, your Dad's here, Bingo.

Dad!

Bingo!

Ohh!

Oh, that was a hard one.

Dad! Dad!

Exciting news!

What's that?

It's my turn to bring Bob Bilby home!

Oh, wow!

He's a bilby, and his name is Bob.

Bob, this is my Dad.

He's not actually real.

He's a puppet.

You have to fold his ears\
down when you say that.

Oh, okay.

Hi, Bob.\
Nice to meet you.

Well, let's you get back home\
and show you around.

This episode of Bluey\
is called Bob Bilby.

I took Bob Bilby home\
when I was at kindy.

Do you remember that, Bingo?

Um, ah, yeah, I think so.

Bob stays with us for the weekend,

and we take photos of all\
the fun stuff we get up to,

and then we stick them\
in the Bob Bilby book.

This is Bob at Jasper W.'s house.

And this is with Harley.

Ooh, you did a bit of karate, Bob.

Oh, wakadu.

I won't be messing with you.

And this is when he went\
on a holiday with Mrs. Terrier.

Oh, yes, she took Bob with her\
when she went to Scotland.

Wow, Bob, you've really\
been around.

I hope we can show you\
a good time, too.

What do you reckon, kids?

Yeah!

-Hey! That's mine! Let go!

-No, Bob, that's Dad's.\
-Grrr!

Careful, Dad,\
he knows karate.

Okay, I'll take\
the photo now.

Come on, moo cow!

Walk over here!

Moo --Ah! Eee! Ah!

Moo!

Okay, smile, Bob!

-Ohhh!

Let me see!

Bob, this is the tablet.

-You can take photos with it

and watch cartoons

-and play games.

Let's show Bob that game\
where you give

Santa's beard a haircut.

-Yeah!

-Not too long on that, kids.

Don't you want to teach Bob\
some car games?

Cartoooons!

All right, there you go.

Yeah!

♪ Yeah, yeah, baby ♪

Okay, who wants to be in charge\
of the shopping list?

Bob?

♪ Yeah, yeah, baby ♪

Bob, this is\
Mixed Up Murphy.

He's really funny.

Yeah, really funny.

Running down the wing...

♪ Yeah, yeah, baby ♪

Kids, that's enough\
of that thing.

I'm sure Bob is sick of --

-Noooooo!\
-Ah, whatever.

Kids, I'm putting our\
photos in Bob Bilby's book!

Cool! Let us see!

These are just all of Bob\
watching cartoons.

Oh, wow.

Yep.

He doesn't look like\
he's having much fun.

No, he doesn't, does he?

♪ Yeah, yeah, baby ♪

Oh, Bingo!

Are you all right, Bingo?

This is the most boring time

Bob's had in the whole book.

Now, that's not true, kiddo.

Yeah, it is.

I'm the worst friend Bob's got.

He's never going to want to visit again.

Ohhh!

Okay. Let's sort this out.

What's the best move right now? Hmm.

I know!

Bob just copies whatever it is we do,\
and we were only doing boring stuff.

So all we need to do\
is really exciting stuff.

Yeah.

But how are we gonna take\
a photo without the tablet?

Ah, leave that to me.

This is all my stuff from\
when I used to be cool.

Ah, here it is.

What is that?

This is what a real camera looks like.

Are you ready, Bob?

- Ooh!

- Yay! Eee!

Whee!

Wheeee! Hee!

Ooh!

And this is Bob visiting\
Daddy's friend Stevo.

He let Bob turn the siren on,\
but it was very loud.

And this is Bob and I getting\
a book out of the library.

The end.

Well Bingo, it looks like

Bob has had a wonderful time\
staying with you.

Now, why don't you give Bob to Missy.

It's her turn with him next.

There you go, Bob.

Thanks for coming to visit me.

I hope you'd like to visit me again.

Goodbye.

# "Spy Game" (Season 1 Episode 13)
Mum!

Dad!

Bingo!

- Bluey!

Bunkers, can you\
get me a drink, please?

Coming, honey.

Hey, can you grab us\
the onions?

Get 'em yourself.

Oh, yeah,\
that's real friendly.

-Oh!

This episode of Bluey\
is called Spy Game.

I got my mum!

I got Chloe's dad!

Stop!\
What's the password?

Um...

Zebra.

-Zebra.\
-Correct. You may enter.

Here's the samples,\
Bingo.

My name is Sparkleshot.

-Come on, Bingo.\
-Grr!

Now, I'm gonna go\
and get Dad's sample.

Bluey, can I get Dad?

No, Mackenzie and I are the spies.

Your job is to gather grass\
for the potion.

Aw!

What if we don't need a potion?

What about if we use this wand instead?

I already told you.

Only potion grass can control grown-ups.

-Oh yeah, that's right.

So, you go and get\
some more potion grass, Bingo.

Yeah, yeah?

Okay.

Let's go, Mackenzie!

New password is, uh, "diplodocus!"

Where's that sausage tray gone?

You don't know what you're doing.

Oh, you're burning them.\
You're burning them!

They'll be right.

Dad!

I need the toilet.\
I'm busting.

Hey, what are you kids\
doing down there?

Bingo!

You're meant to be getting potion grass.

I don't want to collect\
potion grass anymore.

And my name is Sparkleshot.

Grr, you're not\
playing spies anymore.

Good.

Come on, Bingo.

Don't turn those top ones yet!

Good riddance.

Oh, who's gonna get\
the potion grass?

Password!

Diplodocus.

Bingo's not playing anymore.

Honey, you have to get\
the potion grass now.

What? But I'm a guard!

Not anymore.

Aw.

Uh, Chloe,

do you mind getting the potion grass?

Um, no thanks.\
I like being a guard, too.

But I can shout "password"\
the loudest, though.

- Passwoooord!

What if we don't need potion grass?

We just use...\
this chip packet.

That won't work.

It might.\
They're barbecue flavor.

And the parents\
are having a barbecue.

Let's try it.

-But who's gonna stand guard?\
-Whoo! Whoo!

You do it, Bluey.\
I'm off to spy.

Hey, what?

But I'm a spy!

Hmph.\
The password is "grumpy."

♪ One man went to mow ♪

♪ Went to mow a meadow ♪

♪ One man and his dog ♪\
Arf!

♪ Went to mow a meadow ♪

How you going in there, Bingo?

I can feel my sausages burning.

I started just doing a wee,\
and now it's turned into a poo.

♪ Two men went to mow ♪

♪ Went to mow a meadow ♪

I got the hairs!

Okay, now you\
stand guard, Mackenzie,

and I'll go get some more.

Chloe's almost finished the spell!

Let's put this pinecone in, too.

Peshoo!\
It's ready!

Whee! Now we can control the grown ups!

I'm first!

Okay, Bluey's mum.

Get up and dance around.

Whoo-hoo!

Go, baby!

No, not Honey's mum.

I said, "Bluey's mum."

It's not working properly.

-Let me try!\
-Yow!

-I'm going first!\
-Let me try! Yow!

I can do it!

Maybe we need another pinecone.

Little bit more.\
Little bit more.

Hey, Bluey.\
You need the toilet, too?

No one's playing\
the game properly.

Ah, is this the spy game?

Yeah, no one's\
doing their jobs.

And when did this\
start happening?

Hmm, it started when...

Bingo stopped playing.

Finished!

Check this out.\
We're dogs, kid.

We all have a place in the pack.

Now, look what happens\
when I take the bottom one out.

Does that make sense?

No.

Okay, just do your best, kid.

This one...\
and this one.

And this one.

Bingo, can you come\
and play with us again?

Bluey, I'm Sparkleshot.

I've told you this before.

Sorry.

Do you still want to play?

Well, can I get to do a spy?

Well, no.

Aw!

But I promise, I'll think\
of something really fun.

Okay.

- Mackenzie!\
- I'm going first!

-No, no, I can do it!

-Honey!\
-Let me try.

My turn first!

It's not working properly!

Look who's back!

Bingo!

Okay, here's the plan.

Mackenzie, you and me\
are going to do the last spy.

Honey and Chloe, stand guard.

And Bingo, you get the potion grass.

Yeah!

He was\
thinking, "I'm not going,"

-and I was like, "Yes, you are."

-Ahh, mozzie!

Password!

Sweetie, we need\
the sausage tray.

Password!

Uh, "sausage tray?"

Wrong! That's not the password!

Aw, never mind,\
I'll use something else.

I'm going first.

-No, I'm going first!\
-No, me!

I know how to do it.

I'm going fiiiirst!

Nooo, Bingo's going first.

For real life?

For real life.

Oh, thanks, Bluey.

-Go, Bingo!\
-Yeah!

-Yeah, Bingo!\
-Go, Bingo!

Okay, grown-ups...

go crazy!

-Whoa! It worked!

Well done, Bingo --

ooh, I mean Sparkleshot.

Nice one, Bandit.

Get him!

Looks like\
we're gonna have pizza, kids! 

# "Takeaway" (Season 1 Episode 14)
Mum!

Dad!

Bingo!

- Bluey!

This episode of Bluey\
is called Takeaway.

Ooh, can I have a shower\
under that tap?

No wet dogs in car.

-Aww!\
-Dad?

Yeah, mate?

Where do rocks come from?

Uhhh...

Can we have some\
of your takeaway, too?

-Yeah!\
-You girls don't like spicy.

Ooh, I like spicy.

You squirts wait here.\
I'll be two seconds.

-Raaah!

Alright!\
Let's boogie.

-Yeah!\
-Yes, boogie.

Hang about!

Stay.

Aaah!

Pbbt!

Pbbt!

Five more minutes, kids.

They forgot the spring rolls!

Hey, babe. What's up?

They forgot\
the spring rolls!

Oh! Your Dad\
and spring rolls!

They're just cooking 'em now.

Forget 'em, babe.\
The kids must be starving.

Not...leaving...\
without...spring rolls.

Say "See ya, Mum."

See ya, Mum!

-Well, good luck.

Leave without\
the spring rolls?

Is she crazy?

How long is five minutes?

Uh, it's one episode\
of "Chutney Chimp."

What are we\
gonna play?

We're gonna play\
Dad Reads The Newspaper.

Ooh, can I buy a juice?

What do these words say?

No idea, kiddo.

And no. There's a tap over there\
if you're thirsty.

Please, can I have\
a shower in it?

Don't even think about it.

Dad, can you help me?

Do you need a drink, too, Bingo?

No, I'm not thirsty.

Can I eat these plants?

No, mate.

- Aah! Ohh!

Which way do you turn it off?

Why are some plants food,\
like lettuce,

but other plants\
aren't food?

Uh, well --

Dad, can I play with these?

Uh, just two, kid.\
The shop guys need 'em.

How about three?

Two.

Dad, I'm thirsty.

But I just --

Oh, never mind.

Aah!

Aww!

Quickly --grab two more,\
but hang on to them.

Ohhh, I'm starving.

Can I have some takeaway?

Of course you can, customer.

Welcome to my takeaway restaurant.

Please, do sit down.

Up! Sst! Sst! Sst!\
Get off!

Oh, thank you.

Here are some menus, Bingo.

You can have two,\
in case you want lots of food.

My name isn't Bingo.

It's, uh...

...Tap Girl.

Can I have this, Dad?

I need to write\
Tap Girl's order down.

So, Ma'am,\
what would you like?

I'm just gonna check\
on the spring rolls.

I'll have some\
super-spicy, please.

Certainly.\
I'll just get that now.

Yechh! Wet menu!

Blegh!

-Ooh!\
-Me, me!

Uh, Tap Girl, I'm not sure\
you can eat it for real life.

But I'm hungry.

Aah! Oh! Aah!\
Aah! Aah!

Too spicy!

Ah, they're not ready yet.

Hey! My dinner!

Aaah!

Too spicy!

Okay, okay,\
come here, mate.

How's that, kiddo?

Good.

But I need to do a wee.\
I'm busting.

Oh, man!

Okay. Umm...

I'm a walrus.

-Excuse me --

Bluey, don't even\
think about it!

Where's the nearest toilet?

Oh, that's too far!

Bingo, can you hold on till we get home?

I'm busting!

Okay, okay.

It's a bush wee.

-Dad?\
-Yeah, mate?

Is everything in the whole world\
made of atoms?

Uh, yeah, I think so.

Aaah!\
I can't turn it off!

-Bluey!\
-I only meant to turn it on a little bit!

Don't even think\
about getting under that!

There's water everywhere!

Bingo, are you almost finished?

Not yet.\
It's a long one.

-Get out of it!\
-No, Mr Crow!

It's too spicy for you!

What will happen\
if we can never turn it off?!

Get outta here!

The water will be up to the clouds!

Are you finished yet, Bingo?

Almost!

Arghhh!

This is a really long wee, Bingo!

Finished!

Get outta here!

Yeah!

Dad?

Yes, mate?

If grown-ups grow from babies\
and only grown-ups have babies,

who had the first baby?

Okay, forget\
the spring rolls.

Let's just get out of here.

Whoa! Ooh!

Sorry. Your spring rolls\
will be five more minutes.

What?

That's a whole other\
"Chutney Chimp."

Sorry about the wait.

Would you kids like\
some fortune cookies?

Thank you.

What's happened out here?

They're biscuits.

With a little paper inside.

And writing on the paper.

What does it say?

It says\
"Flowers may bloom again,

but a person never has\
the chance to be young again."

What does that mean?

It means...

...it's shower time!

For real life?

For real life.

Spring rolls are ready!

Oh, great.\
Just pop 'em on the table.

Thanks.

No worries.

Oh, that looks fun. 

# "Butterflies" (Season 1 Episode 15)
Mum!

Dad!

Bingo!

- Bluey!

Make sure it's nice and high\
off the ground.

Yes, boss.

-Snap!\
-Ow! Bluey!

-That's not making this any easier.

What are you doing,\
Bluey's Dad?

-Hey, Judo.\
-Just putting up a swing.

Yeah, it's a fabric swing.

Yeah, they have them at Bluey's school.

I know that.\
Bluey's my friend.

All right, have fun, squids.

I've gotta take the washing in.

Let's play butterflies!

-Yeah!\
-Yeah!

This episode of Bluey\
is called Butterflies.

Okay, first, the caterpillar\
crawls along the ground,

then it gets in the cocoon.

Then it hatches as a butterfly.

But the butterfly catchers\
have been hiding and catch it.

Ooh, can I be\
the caterpillar first?

I'm going first.

Come on, Bingo. We'll be\
the butterfly catchers.

Eep, eep, eep, eep,\
eep-eep-eep-eep.

Judo is so bossy.

Yeah, she is,

but she doesn't have\
anyone else to play with.

Ooh!

Uh, I might go and see\
if Bingo's all right.

She'll be fine.\
Now, let's play phones.

Phones?

Ring, ring.

Ring, ring!

I just think that\
Bingo might like --

-Ring, ring!\
-Aaah! Hello?

Hi.\
It's me, Judo.

I've had\
such a nice day.

Let me tell you\
all about it.

Okay.

First, I bought\
some lovely new plants,

-but then I...\
-Oh, is that right?

So, then I went to the bakery

to get some cream buns\
for Casper,

but they ran out\
of cream buns.

Could you believe it?

Judo, I think\
I need to find Bingo.

So then I asked\
for chocolate éclairs...

-Judo --\
-...but they were out of them, too.

I mean, come on.

I just don't know\
what the world's coming to.

Okay, then.\
I'm going now. Bye.

I mean, are you trying\
to run a shop?

Bingo!

Bingo, where are you?

-Bingo!\
-Hey!

I'm sorry, Bingo, I didn't mean\
to run away from you.

Judo made me do it.

Well...\
she didn't make me do it.

I did it a bit myself.

I'll never do it again,\
Bingo. I promise.

You ran away from me.

Well, you ran away from me!

And you were ignoring me.

Oh, yeah. I did.

Okay, new rule.

From now on,

no one runs away\
from anyone, okay?

-Okay.\
-Okay.

Sorry, Judo.

That's okay.\
I'm sorry, too, Bingo.

That's okay.\
Just don't do it again.

All right, Bingo,\
you can be the butterfly.

Actually, I wanna be\
the catcher.

-Me too.\

Oh, but who will we catch, then?

Mum!

Dad!

Bingo!

- Bluey!

Can you play games with us?

No time for games, squirt.

I'm working from home today.

One sec. I just\
gotta pop downstairs.

Doot!

-Okay, I'm back.

Is this yours?

It's a work day today.

Now, Bingo!

Ugh!

Hey!

Don't even think about it!

-Stay! Stay!

Push!

You little rats!

Why do you sit\
on a giant green ball?

'Cause I wrecked my back\
changing your nappies.

-Boing, boing, boing, boing, boing!

I want a turn doing that.

Boing, boing...

boing, boing, boing, boing...

boing!

Okay, now beat it.\
I've gotta get to work.

Oooooooh.

No, not yet!

Bluey!

Ohh!

So, then Mixed Up Murphy says,

"Would smoothie banana you like?"

Oh, Ball-E, you need to sleep.

You must be so tired.

That big Dad has been\
sitting on you all day.

Uh, Ball-E, which tattoo should I get?

Do you like the unicorn

or...\
or the rainbow?

Well, Bingo --

My name is Larn.

Well, Larn, I really think\
you should get the --

-There it is!

Out.

Can we play Delivery Chair?

No!

Oh, pleeease!

Oh, don't use\
your "please" face!

Oh, all right.

Yeah, Bingo!\
Delivery Chair!

That "please" face gets me every time.

Now I need to get\
these two packages delivered.

But first, I need to stamp them.

Stamp!

Stamp!

Ooooooh.

Okay, now I need\
to deliver these to --

Hmm. Let's see.

Oh, Mogadishu.

Okay, here's one package.

-Oh --marked "fragile." Okay.

Well, I'd better be careful, then!

And here's the second package!

Ooof!

Okay, delivery over.

Now I've gotta get back to work.

Oh, come on! One more!

No!

Oooooh.

♪ Ba ba-da ba\
bum bum bum ♪

Can we just quickly play that game\
where we run down the hall

and you sing\
♪ "Da-na-na-na"

and you roll the ball down the hall

and we jump out of the way?

Oh, you mean Raiders?

Yeah, Raiders!

-Yeah, Raiders.\
-All right.

Maybe a quick game.

Hooray!

Not quick, though.

I want you to play\
for...this long.

Okay.\
Fair enough.

-Hooray!\
-Hooray!

-You ready?

-Yeah!\
-Yeah!

Okay...

Again!

Again!

Ooh!

Ooooooh.

Okay, game over.

I have to do some work.

Walk it off, sport.

Hey, Bingo.

Oh, what's the matter?

Daddy's playing too rough with me.

Yeah. He does play too rough\
sometimes, doesn't he?

Yes.

Did you use your big-girl bark?

No.

Because I don't have\
a very good big-girl bark.

Really? Show me.

Ruff.

Oh, that's all right.

Just do it bigger.

Ruff!

Bigger.

-Ruff!!\
-Whoa!

There it is!

Come on.

Let's go talk to your Dad.

Ruff!

Go away!

What's up?

You're in trouble!

No one's in trouble.

Bingo just has something\
she'd like to tell Dad.

That's all.

Sometimes, you play\
a bit too rough with me.

Aw, Bingo.\
Really?

Aw, sorry, Buster.\
I didn't realize.

I think I just forget

that you're a bit younger\
than your sister.

I'm only 4.

Yeah, not 6, like me.

But, Dad, we don't want you\
to stop playing with us.

Oh, okay.

I'm just gonna get better\
at using my big-girl bark.

Okay.\
Well, let's practice.

Okay.

So, tell me, is this rough okay?

Boing!

Yes, that's okay.

Okay, how about this rough?

Boing!

Yes, that's okay.

Okay, what about this?

-Boing!\
-Ruff!

Okay. Too rough.

Now I know.

All right, now, clear out, you lot.

I've got to --

Hey! Where's my ball?!

I'll just be a second!

Oh, my! How rude!

Can't you see that I'm on the toilet?

This episode of Bluey\

Look at this lovely stick\
I found, Pretzel.

I don't feel like\
playing anything.

Okay.

Calypso, can I please have\
a gnome for my village?

Well, let's have a look.

Well, the gnome will need\
a place to sleep,

so...

Okay.

You busy, Bluey?

No, not yet.

This is a fish and chip shop,

but we've run out of fish,\
so it's just chips.

Okay. Well, be patient.

Oh, I had no sleep all night.

-Ooh!\
-Ooh, sorry, Coco.

My, it certainly is crowded in here.

It sure is.

I might have to move out soon.

Did you know that a fish and chip shop\
just opened next door?

Did you hear that, Roderick?

We'll have to pop over.

That looks good.

I'm building a house.

It's going to have\
a bottom room and a top room.

Wonderful!

I think Indy is looking\
for somewhere to live.

Hmm.

And the Terriers\
have made another fort.

We're Romans!

I can see.

Now, you are here\
to prote the kingdom?

Yes, Calypso!

That's good.

Do you need protecting?

Not right now, thanks.

Ugh!

Calypso, can I please have a gnome now?

Let's have a look.

I made a place for her to sleep.

Lovely, but...

she'll also need a forest\
for her morning walk.

Oh, yeah!

You cheeky baby.

You're so beautiful.

-Hi, Bluey!\
-Hi!

Ooh, you have so many customers.

I know! I'm so busy.

What's going on with you?

I'm moving out.

Ooh! Where to?

I don't know.

Hi, Indy!

Do you want to move into my house?

Yeah!

You can rent the upstairs room\
for 10 dollarbucks.

Great! But I don't have any dollarbucks.

Hmm.

Maybe you need a job.

Yeah! I could be\
a waitress for Bluey.

Can you mind Polly?

-Sure.\
-Bye!

Do you want to learn\
how to build a fence, Polly?

Indy!\
Do you need protecting?

Not right now, thanks!

Okay!

Calypso, can I have a gnome nowwwww?

Well, let's have a look.

Well, it's looking wonderful!

Is there anything else\
you can think of

that a gnome might enjoy?

Hmmm.

Yes!

Here's your cups of tea.

Thank you.

Are the fish and chips almost ready?

Almost.\
But we're out of fish.

Oh, Indy, here's your dollarbucks

for being my waitress.

Thanks, Bluey.

-Hi, Rusty.

Here's my dollarbucks\
for the upstairs room.

And I brought you some chips.

Thanks!

Okay, I'll just\
get back to work.

Do you want some chips, Polly?

Do you need protecting yet?

Not yet!

Okay!

Actually...

would you like some\
fish and chips, Terriers?

Yes, please!

Can we have enough\
to feed our whole army?

Okay.

But it might just be chips,\
because we're out of fish.

Okay!

Bluey, the Terriers want

enough fish and chips\
to feed an army.

Wow! Okay.

How about these are\
all sacks of chips?

Yeah!

One sack, two sacks, three sacks.

Look at this!

This is beautiful!

Oooh!

Is it ready for a gnome\
to come and live here?

Of course it is.

Look at it!

Being protecting Romans\
is a little bit boring.

Maybe we should be...

invading Romans!

Mmm, maybe.

Five sacks!\
Six sacks!

There you go, Indy.\
Take them to the Terriers.

Okay, Bluey!

The gnome watches over all the people.

Indy, no!

You're gonna step on my village!

Terriers!

Hut!

The village needs protecting!

Hut!

Tortoise formation!

Yeah!

Good one, Terriers!

Hut!

Oh. Hi, Terriers.

Here's your chips.

Sorry -- we're out of fish.

Well,\
thank goodness for the Terriers.

Well, I guess you can sit\
in my boat, if you want.

Oh. Thanks.\
I won't take up much room.

I'm a fisherman.

Mm. I can see.

Have you caught anything?

Not yet.

Well, just be patient.

They'll bite eventually.

Oh. If you do catch a fish, let me know.

Oh, okay. Why?

Because there's someone\
I'd like you to meet.

# "The Doctor" (Season 1 Episode 18)
Mum!

Dad!

Bingo!

Ring, ring!

This is the doctor's office!

Hello. It's Edna speaking.

How are you?

Hello, I need to see the doctor now.

Mm, yes, okay.

Sure, okay, we'll see you in 15 months.

Bye. Click.

Thank you, Doctor.\
My schnozz feels great.

Just keep it on for six months.

See ya!

Please choose a lollipop on your way out.

Why, thank you.

Ooh, lychee.

This episode of Bluey\
is called The Doctor.

Sorry about that.\
How can I help?

I need to see the doctor.

Oh, yes, I'm sure we can\
squeeze you in tightly.

Great!

Now, what's wrong with you today?

Nothing.\
I'm fine.

Honey, playing doctors,

you have to make up\
something wrong with you.

Oh, yes, of course.

What do you think\
should be wrong with me?

It's up to you.

Um, what if I bumped\
my knee?

Okay, here's a clipboard.

Please take a seat.

The doctor won't be long.

Honey, you have to hobble when you walk.

Oh, yes.

Next patient, please.

That's me!

Hobble!

What seems to be the matter?

She's bumped her knee, Doctor.

Oh. You sure that's it?

Yeah, that's it.

Okay, we'll have that fixed in a jiffy.

I need to see the doctor!

Ooh, there's a crocodile on my head!

Oh, my.\
This is a real pickle.

-Don't worry.\
-Ohh!

We'll fix that in a jiffy.

Edna, hold my appointments.

Oh, I'm sorry dear.\
Please take a seat.

I'm sure the doctor won't be long.

This is gonna take ages!

Oh, okay.

I'm just trying to pull the mouth open!

Ugh!

-This might sting...\
-Ugh!

...but just for a little bit!

-Aah!\
-Aah!

He's a wily one!

Yaaaah!

Oh, careful, Doctor! Aah!

Would you like a cup of tea\
while you wait?

Yes, thanks.

-Ugh!\
-Yaaaah!

Here you go.

Are you sure you haven't\
been attacked

by a giraffe or something?

-Um, no.\
- Yah!

Cause that would be a real pickle.

There it goes!

Oh. Looks like she's done.

Out you come.

Beautiful, Doctor.

Just keep the bandages\
on for 11 years.

Choose a lollipop.

See ya.

Okay, who's next?

That's me.

Oh, yes -- sore knee.\
Right this way.

Help! I cuddled a cactus!

Oh, no!

Aah!

And then a crocodile\
flew out of the sky

and bit me on the bottom!

My stars!\
This is a real pickle!

Don't worry. We'll have you\
fixed in a jiffy.

Oww, oww, oww,\
oww, oww!

Edna, hold my appointments!

Oww, oww, oww, oww!

Ohh!

But what about my knee?

- Oww!

Aah! Wriggling will just\
make it harder!

Oh, I'm sorry about the wait, Honey.

Am I definitely\
the next patient, Bluey?

You are definitely\
the next patient.

We need to see the doctor!

Oh, my!

I was hanging out the washing,\
and my arms fell off!

And I got bitten\
by seven scorpions.

Oh, my, my!

Oh, this looks like\
a real pickle.

-It is!\
-It is!

I'm never gonna see the doctor.

Don't worry, Honey.

I promise you'll be the next patient.

Really?

Yes.\
Definitely.

Yaaaah!

I need a doctor!

What's wrong, Rusty?

I accidentally ate a hippopotamus.

And now when I burp,\
I burp out baby hippopotamuses.

Burp!

Aah!

Oh, no! Baby hippos!

Quick, Indy, grab it!

But I've got no arms!

Aah!

Get 'em!

Get 'em out!\
Get him!

Come on, little wriggly one!

Get away, baby hippo!

Burp!

-Aah!\
-Two more!

Aah! Hippos everywhere!

Oh, my, goodness,\
this is a real pickle.

Rusty, you best come\
in here right away.

Ohhhh!

Edna, hold my appointments.

I knew it.

- Stay still!\
- Burp!

How many hippos have you got in there?

Can I have a lollipop?

-Yaaah!\
-Burp!

Don't be sad, Honey.

Ohhh!

Everyone's problem is\
a real pickle, except mine.

-Burp!\
-Oh, my!

-Aah!\
-Oh, there's another one!

Burp!\
They're everywhere!

Yahh!\
Come here!

-Yaaaah!

You always make me laugh.

Yeah, I always make you laugh.

Come here, you baby hippo!

Do it again.

Do something funny.

Okay, watch this.

Now, for most dogs,

their tail wags,\
and their body stays still.

But not me.\
Ta-da!

That's so funny!

Oh, thanks, Doctor.

I won't eat any more\
hippopotamuses again.

I think there are --

there are some lollipops\
around here...somewhere.

Oh, my stars!

Your tail and your body\
are all mixed up!

Her body's wagging!

But her tail is still!

This is a real pickle.

Really?\
A pickle?

This is the biggest pickle\
I've ever seen.

Come with me right away.

Don't worry.

We'll have you fixed up in a jiffy.

Hobble!

Edna, you best hold\
all of my appointments.

Sure thing.

Will the doctor be much longer?

Oh, just be patient!

Boop.

Yeah!

Congratulations!

-Enough toys for all!\
-Yee!

You wanna play again, Bluey?

Uh, no thanks.

It's not the same.

That's not how you do it.

Hey!

Oh, here we go.

Strap yourselves in, kids.

Ding-da-da-ding-ding-ding!\
Brrt-brrt-brrt!

Insert coin for awesome prizes.

Cha-ching!

This machine doesn't\
take imaginary coins.

Go and get a job\
and earn real ones.

Mum, can we have\
some real coins?

-Zzzzt!\
-Aaaah!

-I said go and get a job.

Well...

if you kids make\
Mum and Dad's bed,

I'll give you 20 cents.

You lose!

Greydancer!

Magic Claw!

Insert more coins!

Come on, Bingo!

Let's do more jobs.

This is great.

They're learning a lesson,\
and we get the house cleaned.

Neither of those things\
are happening.

-Okay.\
- Boop, boop!

Let's do this.

Cha-ching!

Boop!

Ding, ding, ding, ding.

You lose!

Dad!

This isn't fair!

I am not Dad.

I am Magic Claw.

Magic Claw has no children.

His days are free and easy.

Ohh!

Greydancer's getting lonely without me.

I tried to get her, Bingo,

but this Magic Claw is too hard.

-Ooh.

Ooh.

Now!\
Push the button!

Boop!

Congratulations. You are a winner.

-Yes!\
-Yeah!

You did it!

Oh, Greydancer, I missed you.

Again!

Okay, let's play\
something different now.

Oh, what's this?

Some sort of bonus prize.

-Ooh!\
-Ooh!

What does it say on it?

It says...

"two bottomless bowls\
of ice cream for the holder."

You spelled "holder" wrong.

Bottomless.

What's that mean?

It means\
if you get that block,

you get as much ice cream\
as you want

after dinner tonight.

-Whoo!\
-Whoo!

Ice cream!

But don't get excited,\
'cause I know your Dad.

I am not Dad.

We need more coins!

Ohh!

Not more chores.

Magic Claw will give you one coin

for that dolphin toy.

Okay.

Greydancer!

Bluey!

Please, Bingo.

After I win the ice cream bottom block,

I'll win Greydancer back, too.

Yeah?\
Yeah?

Uh, okay.

Da-ding-ding!

Nice doing business with you.

Cha-ching!

Boop!

I got it!

-Bring it up!

Apologies, valued customer.

The block is too heavy\
for Claw to lift.

Better luck next time.

What?!

Oh, no!

Greydancer's stuck forever.

You see, kids,

the lesson is --

Tickle him!

-Aah!

Stop, canines!

Do not tickle Magic Claw!

Yaaaa!

That's a girl, Bingo!

Stick it to the man!

I've got it!

Greydancer!

Come on, Bingo!

Bzz! Machine uprising!

Ow!

Get him, Greydancer!

Ooh! Oh!\
Ah! Ooh!

Yeah!

More ice cream, please!

She came!

The Tooth Fairy came!

Hey, nice one, Bluey!

Way to go, kid.

She left me five bucks!

Five bucks?

Yeah, I know.

Five bucks!

Five bucks?

That's what she left\
all Bluey's friends.

Well, that Tooth Fairy's\
doing well for herself, isn't she?

Hey, maybe you can spend it\
at the markets today.

Yeah!

This episode of Bluey\
is called Markets.

This little piggy\
went to market,

and this little piggy stayed home.

Hey! No, I didn't.

I'm coming, too!

Check this out, Bingo.

The Tooth Fairy even put\
a special sticker on here.

Wow.

What are you gonna\
spend it on?

That's the question.

Hmm, that is a question.

Hmm, question.

Bluey!

Indy!

Look, Indy.

The Tooth Fairy\
gave me five bucks!

Wow!

What are you gonna spend it on?

I don't know.

Can you come and help me?

Yeah!

Mum, can I go and help Bluey?

Sure thing, Indy.

I'll keep an eye on 'em.

Follow me!

Giant bubbles!

Wow!

Do you wanna get one?

Yeah, I do.

Wait!

Pony ride!

Excuse me.

What's that pony's name?

Her name's Biscuits.

-Aww!\
-Aww!

And what's that one's name?

Buttermilk.

-Aww!\
-Aww!

I really,\
really want to ride Buttermilk.

Definitely Buttermilk.

Can we ride Buttermilk, please?

Okay, honey.

Up you get.

Okay, Indy, you can sit in front.

Oh, I'm sorry, honey,

but you don't have enough money\
for two riders.

Oh. I only want to go\
if Indy can come.

It's okay, Bluey.

I'll wait here.

Hmm.

I think I've changed my mind.

Well, aren't you a good friend?

Yes, Pony Lady.

Goodbye, Buttermilk.

You're so beautiful.

German sausage!

German sausage!

German sausage!

Okay, I want\
a German sausage

and the squirty sauce,

but only on one end,\
so you can have the other end.

But I'm not allowed that.

Why not?

Mum says it's got added ingredients...?

Can you have barbecue sauce?

I'm not allowed that one either.

Mustard?

I'm definitely not allowed mustard.

Well, what are we\
gonna get then?

Poffertjes! Poffertjes!

Indy!

Poffertjes!

Poffertjes?

Have these got any\
wheat, sugar,

gluten, or dairy\
in them?

That's all they've got in them.

-Ohhh!\
-Aww!

My friend can't eat them.

Bye, girls.

Poffertjes!

I just don't know what to get.

Anyone want the last toffee apple?

I've got one toffee apple left.

Oh, oh.

I will!

Lovely, jubbly.

Thank you.

I'm pretty sure that has sugar in it.

Ah, toffee apple.

Old school.

I'm not sure I like\
this toffee apple.

Plus, Indy can't have any.

Oh, that's no good.

Thank you!

Ah, thanks buddy!

Aaaaaah!

That deserves a song.

Dad, I'm not sure\
I made the right choice.

I think I want to put my\
five bucks in that case

and get a song.

Oh, right.

Can I get my five bucks back?

That's not really\
how it works, kiddo.

Once you've spent money, it's...

well, gone.

Oh.

Okay.

Don't worry, Bluey.

My mum always says to me,

"What goes around\
comes around."

What does that mean?

I don't know.

Sweetheart, can you\
go get your Dad

a German sausage, please?

Okay, Dad.

-Here we go!

Now, that's a tune.

One sausage, please!

Thanks.\
There you go.

Thanks!

Gruber, go get me a carrot juice.

Sure thing, Dad.

Carrot juice, please.

Oh, we're out of carrots.

Will you get me a bag\
of carrots please, Juniper?

Yes, Mum.

I'd like these carrots, please.

Just these, please.

I'll have that one, thank you.

Indy?

Yes, Mum?

Be a sweetie.

Go and pop this in the guitar case for me.

Okay!

Look, Bluey!

Whoa!\
Five bucks?

Thanks, matey!

That deserves another song.

Who likes to dance?

-Whoo-hoo!\
-Ah!

2, 3, 4!

And this little piggy went,

-"Wee, wee, wee, wee, wee, wee, wee, wee"

all the way home!

Dad! I've lost\
another tooth!

Ah, great.

I told you she was no fun.

Race you!

-[Bingo giggles]\
-Hey!

-[screech!]\
-Whoa, look!

Stay back, little sister!

We don't know what that is!

[giggles] Don't worry. It's friendly.

Brrr!

We'd best get going.

Hooray!

Hooray!

[Bluey and Bingo giggle]

This is too steep.

Oh, big sister, don't be\
a stick in the mud.

[gasps]

What a view!

How do we get down?

We slide! Whee!

Whee!

Okay.

Here we goooo!

[laughs]

Whee!

Yeah!\
That was fun!

[laughs]

It's so soft and squishy!

Boing!\
Boing!

It is soft and squishy,\
isn't it, little sister?

It's like we're bouncing\
on a massive pikelet.

[Dad] Grrr!

-[gasps]\
-[Bluey] What's happening?

[all] Aah!

How are we gonna get past\
this big wall?

It's too high to climb!

We'll never find the softest,\
warmest beds in the whole world.

My sweeties,

there's a secret spot somewhere here.

We just have to find it.

Oh, yes!

And if we scratch it, it makes\
the wall come tumbling down.

Hee, okay!

You try over there.

[Dad laughs lightly]

[laughing intensifies]

This is the spot!

Yeah, that's the spot!

You got it!

Come on!

[all] Aah!

Run for your lives!

[all] Hooray!

[laughter]

Yeah!

Oh, I'm having so much fun,\
little sister.

Maybe I do just need to relax\
and enjoy myself more.

I wonder why I ever stopped\
in the first place.

[Dad] Well, hello!

I am a kindly fox.

Oh, look at this cute little fella.

You wouldn't be looking\
for the warmest, softest beds

in the whole world, would you?

We are!

Well, you're in luck.

I can show you the way.

Oh, great!

Did you hear that, kids?

Big sister, I think\
he's a cheeky fox.

A what?!

No, he's a kindly fox.

He said so.

Ooh, look at his cute, little tail.

I'm not so sure.

Oh, come on, little sister.

Now who's being boring?

Hey!

Little sister, we need\
to find the softest,

warmest beds in the whole world,

otherwise, we'll freeze.

Oh, all right.

Okay, kindly fox.

We'd love you to show us the way.

Oh, very good!

Right this way.

[humming]

I'm usually a real worry wart,

but this trek\
to the Blue Mountains

has really shown me\
how to relax and have fun.

Oh, splendid!

I've got my eye on you, Mr Fox.

That sister of yours\
is hard work, isn't she?

She sure is.

It's a cave!

Oh, wow, it stinks!

Yeah, it stinks!

[muffled] I'm sure\
it's not that bad.

Oh, kindly fox,

is there something\
wrong with your voice?

Uh, no,

I just like to talk\
like this sometimes.

Very strange.

Well, we best get going.

Are you coming, too, kindly fox?

Uh, I actually have to go

and buy some more...\
hand cream.

Okay. Thanks for your help.

Yep.\
In you go.

I'm not sure\
this is a good idea.

Oh, quiet, little sister.

Now who's a stick in the mud?

Last one into the cave's\
a rotten egg!

[both] Wait, big sister!

Ah! I'm winning! Yeah!

[muffled]\
Aah!

[both gasp]

Big sister!

Help, little sister!

[normal voice]\
He's licking me!

[muffled]\
Let me out!

It was a trick!

What are you gonna do?!

[laughs]\
You!

You are a cheeky fox!

That's it.

No one traps my big sister.

Hyah!

Raah!

Aah!

Wait for it!

Wait for it!

Bleahh!

[all] Ohh!

[all] Yeah!

Ew.\
I'm all slimy!

Big sister!

Oh, I'm so glad you're safe!

I promise I'll never say\
you're boring ever again.

Oh, I was so busy\
trying to be fun,

I forgot the most important thing\
big sisters are meant to do.

What's that?

Look after their little sisters.

Look!

The softest, warmest beds\
in the whole world!

Yeah!

We found them!

Hooray!

Oh, it's so soft.

And look, there's enough wax in here\
to make a hundred candles!

Ohh!

[laughter]

[Mum] And they all slept\
happily ever after.

[up-tempo music plays] 

# "The Pool" (Season 1 Episode 22)
Mum!

Dad!

Bingo!

- Bluey!

It's hot.

Ohh, it's so hot.

Mum, what are we doing today?

Nothing until you've\
cleaned your teeth.

But I don't want\
to clean my teeth.

It's boring.

Boring things are still important.

No, they're not.

You sound like your Dad.

Hey, squirts!

Uncle Stripe said we could use\
his pool while he's in Bali.

-Yeah!\
-Yeah!

Let's get out of here.

Make sure you take\
all the swimming stuff!

Yeah, yeah,\
we got it covered.

Don't just get the fun stuff.

I mean, the bag of stuff.

Boring!

Yeah, boring!

-Aaah! Hey!

That's nice and cool, actually.

This episode of Bluey\
is called The Pool.

Mum is such a fusspot, isn't she?

She is.

Mum always makes us\
do so many boring things.

She does.

-Dad is way more fun.\
-I am.

Dad, what does...

a-a-a-a-a-b-b-b-

u-u-u-u-u-u-\
k-k-k-k-k-k-

j-j-k-k-k spell?

Oobubbakakayo.

Ee, ow, ooh, ow!\
It's hot!

-Well, stick your thongs on.\
-I didn't bring them.

Ah, okay.

Um, how are\
we gonna do this?

Ow, ow, ow!

Hey, Bingo, what's going on up there?

I'm a giraffe,\
and I'm eating these leaves.

Can someone open this gate?

Can I have my rashie?

-Did you bring it?\
-No.

Then no.

Dad, did we bring sunscreen?

Uh, no, I didn't.

It's okay.\
We don't need sunscreen.

Yes, we do.

We'll just have to stay\
in the shady bit,

and we'll put our hats on.

What hats?

Hey, Bingo, check it out!

My turn!

Can you take that out?

Nah, it keeps\
the pool clean, kiddo.

Can I have my floaties?

I didn't bring 'em.

What?

Um...

You'll have to stay\
on the shallow steps, Bin.

But I won't be able to\
swim away from the crawly thing.

Dad, do you think\
I can swim from this side

to that side all by myself?

Yeah, you definitely could.

No, you have to pretend\
that you don't think I could.

Oh, I mean, no way!\
No one can swim that far!

Watch this.

Oh, hey kiddo, sorry,\
not into the sunny bit.

You've got no sunscreen on.

You'll be all right.

Now, let's chill some beans!

Higher. Higher!

Lower!

Okay.

Heee!

The water's making my eyes stingy.

Yeah, that's the chlorine.\
Did you bring your goggles?

-No.\
-Ah, okay.

Well, we'll just have to play\
above-the-water games, kid.

But I want to dive down\
and get the sinkies.

Did you bring\
the sinkies?

No.

Well, that solves that, then.

Aah! Dad!

Aah!

Ah!

I... want...\
my... floaties!

Dad, is the shady bit\
gonna get bigger or smaller?

Uh...

bigger for sure.

Uh, I meant smaller.

I'm bored.

Hi, bored.\
Nice to meet you.

Ugh!

I'm hungry.

Oh, hello, hungry.\
This is bored.

Ooh, tough crowd.

I want some food.

Aw, yeah, it's morning tea time!

-Yeah!\
-Yeah!

But I didn't bring any food.

-Ohh!\
-Ohh!

You know what, kids?\
I think we might be done.

No! I don't wanna get out!

Come on, Bingo.

I'm coooold!

Well, grab your towel, kid.

I didn't bring one.

Well, just shake.

I haven't learned\
how to shake yet.

Come oooon!

-No, I don't want to get out!

Blblblblblbl!

I'm staying in the pool!

Blblblblbl!

I can't shake properly!

Oi, give us a hand with your sister.

I'm never getting out of this --

Ah! Yah!

Dad, I'm cold!

Dad, I'm freezing!

Dad, I'm hungry.

Dad, I'm starving!

-Dad!\
-Dad!

-Dad!\
-Dad!

Okay!

Can everyone stop saying "Dad"?

I think Dad is actually boring.

Mum is way more fun.

Oh, that's nice to hear.

-Mum!\
-Mum!

I brought all the swim stuff\
you left behind.

-Yeah!\
-Yeah!

Oobubbakaayo!

So, boring things\
are important sometimes, then?

Yes.

Mum brought the sinkies.

Yeah!

Got it!

Okay, ready for the torpedo?

Ready!

You can't get me, crawly thing.

Ha ha!

What was I saying?

Uh, something about... ballet class? 

# "Shops" (Season 1 Episode 23)
Mum!

Dad!

Bingo!

- Bluey!

Let's set up a shop.

Yeah!

Okay, but promise we won't take ages\
deciding stuff, okay?

Well, we'll have to see.

[Bluey This episode of Bluey\
is called Shops.

This can be the shop.

And this can be the till.

And this is the bit\
where it goes "doot, doot!"

This can be the door to the shop.

And it has a bell\
when you walk through it.

And I'll be the customer.

Da-ding!

Hello, shopkeeper.\
I'd like to --

Stop, hang on.\
We have to decide who to be.

Bluey, you promised we wouldn't\
take long deciding stuff.

We can't start if we\
don't know who we all are.

I'll be the shopkeeper.

Aw, I wanted to be the shopkeeper.

Chloe, you can be the assistant.

They hand stuff to the shopkeeper.

Does the assistant get to go "doot"?

Um, yes, but only when\
the shopkeeper is sick

and has to stay home.

Oh. Okay.

Are you feeling sick at all?

No, I'm fine.

I'll be a customer, too.

Yes, you and Mackenzie are customers.

Hooray! Okay, let's go.

Da-ding!\
Hello!

Wait!

What is it now?

Honey, why don't you be a kitten?

Good idea.\
Meow! Meow! Meow!

I'll be your owner.

Good kitty!

-Meow!\
-Okay, let's start!

Da-ding! Hello!\
I'd like to buy a --

-Wait!\
-What?!

What kind of store is this?

How about a kitten store?

What's a kitten store?

A store that sells kittens.

-But I've already got a kitten.\
-Oh, yeah.

How about a store that sells\
things for kittens?

Yeah!

Okay. Da-ding!

Wait! Assistant,\
help me find things

so we can sell for kittens!

Wait. What?

We won't be long!

What do kittens like?

Um, they like lilly-pillys.

Oh, yeah.

These can be the kitten treats.

They're a bit too round.

They're not all round.

Some are a bit bumpy.

-Oh, yeah.\
-Hurry up!

Mackenzie, you're always\
in such a hurry.

We can't play shop if we don't\
have anything to sell.

Okay!

Can we please start?

Yes, yes, yes.

Bluey, are you\
feeling sick yet?

No, I'm fine.

Okay Mackenzie, go!

Finally!

Da-ding!\
Hello!

-Wait!\
-Ugggh!

We don't have anything for money.

It doesn't matter!

You can't buy anything\
if you don't have money.

Oh, yeah, that's true.

How about the round ones are money,

and the bumpy ones\
are kitten treats?

Okey dokey.

Take these, Mackenzie.

These are the dollar bucks.

Okay, let's get going.

Da-ding! Hello!

-Wait!\
-Uggggh!

You also need a kitten birthday cake,

but I'm going to say,\
"Sorry, we've run out."

And then you have to be sad.

Birthday cake?

Bluey, I want it to be that we\
do have a kitten birthday cake.

Okay, we do have a kitten birthday cake,

but you have to be sad 'cause\
it's not the one you want.

I don't know what\
you're talking about.

Let's just start!

Da-ding! Hello!

-Hello!\
-I'd like to buy a --

-Stop!\
-Ugggggh!

I don't think kittens\
should be able to talk.

Really?

Yes.\
Kittens definitely can't talk.

You just have to go like this\
when you want something --

Meow! Meow!

Meow! Meow!

Rrow! Rrow!

Meow! Meow! Meow!

Meoooow!

Okay, let's go. Da-ding!

Wait!

What is it now?

I think I want to be the kitten.

That means I can\
be the shopkeeper!

Doot! Doot!\
Doot!

But I like being the kitten.

Please, Honey,\
you can be the shopkeeper.

Doot!\
What? No way!

Well, how about\
the assistant?

I'll only swap if I'll be\
the kitten owner.

But I'm the kitten owner.

You can be the assistant, Mackenzie.

But I don't want to\
be the assistant.

Ohh!

I'll only swap if I can be the shopkeeper.

Then I can doot things!

Dooting is fun.

Doot! Doot!

Doot! Doot!

Doot! Doot!\
Doot! Doot!

Chloe, can Mackenzie\
be the shopkeeper

and you be the assistant?

But the assistant doesn't doot!

But she hands stuff to be dooted.

Unh-unh.

Well, we can't start\
until someone is the assistant.

Ohhhh!

I'll do whatever we need to do\
to start playing shops.

Will you be the assistant?

-Fine!\
-Great.

Oh, but then we don't\
have a customer.

Grrrr!\
I knew it!

We're never gonna\
start a shop.

I'm leaving!

Mackenzie!

Doot.

Mackenzie!

Can you come back and play shops?

What's the use?

We'll never, ever get to start.

You just want to keep making up\
more and more things.

That's true.

But you just want to start\
before we know who anyone is.

Yeah I do, don't I?

Okay, Bluey, I promise not\
to start until you're ready.

And I promise I'll be ready\
when you start.

Hooray!

Let's play!

Hang on, you still don't\
have an assistant.

Can I play?

Yes!

Thanks. Who can I be?

The assistant!

Great.

Right!

Chloe is the shopkeeper...

Mackenzie is the customer...

Honey is the cat...

and Rusty is the assistant!

Yay!

And Bluey is my other cat!

Yes!

Wait, we've only got one lead.

We sell leads!

Hooray!

-Okay!\
-Okay!

-Meow!\
-Meoooow!

Okay!

I'm gonna do this!

I'm about to open the door.

I'm --I'm coming in!

Is anyone gonna stop me?

No? No?

Just start!

Da-ding! Hi!

I'm here to buy a lead\
for my other kitten.

Certainly, customer.

My assistant will get that for you.

Doot! Here you go.

And here's some kitten\
treats for your pets.

Thanks.\
Here's some dollar bucks.

-Meow!\
-Rrrow!

-Bye!\
-Bye!

Yes!

Let's play Bus Drivers!

Yeah! 

# "Wagon Ride" (Season 1 Episode 24)
Mum!

Dad!

Bingo!

- Bluey!

Monkey bars?

Uh, Chilli?

Asleep.

All right.

Let's do this.

-Hooray!\
-Eeeee!

Monkey bars!\
Monkey bars!

I know!

Let's go in the wagon!

Yeah!

Oh, not the wagon.

This episode of Bluey\
is called Wagon Ride.

Jasmine is coming, too.

More, the merrier.

Okay, let's go!

Seatbelts!

Dad! There are no seatbelts.

Oh, yeah!

Off we go!

Yeah!

First, I'm going to go\
across and then back.

Then I'm going to\
do skipbar one way,

and then double skipbar\
on the way back.

Oh, Jasmine,\
your hair is so knotty.

Morning, Bandit!\
Hey, kids.

Ooh, you're up early.

Gotta be done.

-Hey, why have we stopped?

-This isn't the monkey bars!

Dad, come on!

Bluey, I'm talking.

I'll leave you guys to it.

Bye, girls.

Oh, okay. See ya, Rocko.

Bluey, if I'm talking\
to another grown-up,

you don't interrupt like that, okay?

Dad, I've got a plan.

You're not allowed\
to stop the wagon

and chat to your friends.

You have to take us\
straight to the monkey bars.

No stopping.

Hmm.\
Interesting plan.

I know --\
how about this plan?

I'll do what I want, and you\
don't tell me what to do.

No, I don't like that plan.

We'll stick with mine, thanks.

Okay.\
No problems.

Wait! No!

Yay! We're going home again!

Okay, your plan.

Good decision.

Okay, how about this?

If I'm talking to a grown-up\
and you want me,

you just come up\
and put your hand on my arm.

So now I know\
that you want to talk to me.

Then I'll do this to show you\
that I know you're there

and that\
you want to talk to me.

-What do you think?\
-Yeah!

All right!\
High five!

Aah!\
Got something in my eye.

Let's go!

So, then, after I do skipbar,

I'm going to go upside down\
and be a fruit bat.

Oh, Jasmine, is it really\
your birthday today?

I'll have to get you\
something nice.

Morning, Bandit.

You're up early.

Gotta be done.

How's the little fella?

Yeah, he's good!

He's just learning to roll over.

Oh, wow! Good boy.

Yeah, we're all stoked.

-Hi, Bluey.\
-Hi.

He keeps me up all night, Bandit.

My word.

Yes, Bluey?

Can you please finish talking now\
so we can go to the monkey bars?

Oh, you're heading\
to the monkey bars?

I'd better let you get back to it.

Have fun, Bluey.

Thank you.

Okay, let's go!

Now, that was\
much better, Bluey.

You didn't interrupt, you\
let me know you wanted to talk,

and you waited till I was ready.

-Well done.\
-Thanks.

I still just need you to be\
more patient, though. Okay?

Okay.

I just find it hard to be patient.

I'll give you a hint.

Next time, just watch\
what your sister does.

Okay.

High five!

Ooh! Itchy neck!

Dad!

Come on, Bingo!\
Let's roll!

Coming.

Jasmine, I've got\
some birthday ferns.

Morning, Bandit.\
G'day, kids.

-Hi.\
-You're up early.

Gotta be done.

Come with me, Jasmine.

We need to get dressed for the party.

Come on!

Why is it taking so long?

Jasmine, my dear...

we really must get going.

Oh, no!\
Our wagon is broken down!

How are we gonna\
get to the party?

Hey, Bingo, I know\
how you can get Jasmine

to her party on time.

-Come with me.\
-Okay.

Bus is stopping.

This stop is the art gallery.

Don't forget to tap off!

Please show me your ticket.

Beep!

Thank you!

Can I sit where I want?

Yes, wherever you want.

This bus is heading\
to the party place.

Bye!

Bingo, you're heavy!

Again! Bus stop!

Yeah!

All right, let's go, kids.\
We're almost there.

Oh. Uh...okay.

You won't get us today, bridge troll!

Yeah, bridge troll!\
Eat some other kids!

Right. We're here --\
the monkey bars!

-Can you take us back to the bus stop now?

What? We just got here.

Oh, my! This bus\
certainly is late.

Oh, yes.

I simply have to get home soon\
to feed my pets.

Here it is.

Ah, finally!

Tickets, please.

Anyone else?

Nah, I'll get the next one, mate.

Off we go, bus driver.

You ladies are certainly up early.

Oh, yes.\
It's got to be done.

It's probably on the way.

Let's ask SatNav.

Oh, here we go.

Beep!

SatNav, take us to Stumblytastics, please.

Okay.

Calculating shortest route\
to Stumblytastics.

Mm-hmm.

Continue on this road\

Thanks, SatNav.

SatNav will get us there\
in a jiffy.

Well, I should hope so!

Beep beep!\
Brrrrrrm!

Or was it right?

I think it was right.

I'm not quite sure.

Almost there, Millicent.

Oh! Wait! I recognize\

Oh, no.\
This isn't right.

Oh! Come on!

Sorry.

Agh!

-Blaaah!\
- Aaah!

-Blagh! Bluh-luh-luh-luh!

Her name is Millicent!

You have arrived at Stumblytastics.

To the best of my knowledge.

Finally!

This isn't Stumblytastics.

Yeah, this is the zoo.

Beans on toast!

Why did you take us to the zoo?

I... really wanted...\
to see... the penguins.

Oh, SatNav.

I want to see the penguins, too.

Okay, let's go.

I'll get your stroller.

Unclick.

Other passenger,\
feel free to have a stretch!

I don't want to have a stretch!

Please!

Can't you just take me\
to the airport?

I'm late for my flight!

Sure.

Yeah, love.

Will this take much longer?!

Fix, fix, fix.

Good day to you! Slam!

Have a nice evening!

Where is that airport?

Must be around here somewhere!

Oh! Hello!

Is this the airport?

Yes. You've just made it.

Boarding pass?

Oh.\
Yes, of course.

What's that smell?

Baby vomit.

Oh. Well, the plane\
is just through here.

You have seat 4F,\
just to your left.

Have a nice flight.

4D...4E...

4F! Here we go.

What a day!

Millicent, I do hope\
you don't get airsick, too.

Hello!

Arghh!\
Don't take off!

I want to get off!

Where's the pilot?!

I demand to speak to the pilot!

Yoo-hoo!

That's me!

I'm the pilot!

Ohhh, biscuits! 

# "Pirates" (Season 1 Episode 27)
Mum!

Dad!

Bingo!

- Bluey!

Mum, Dad! Can we play Pirates\
on the hammock swing?

Isn't that game\
a bit too scary for Missy?

It's okay. She'll be brave,\
won't you, Missy?

I'll try, Mr. Heeler.

We'll take care of you, Missy.

Okay, let's play Pirates!

Hooray! Pirates!

This episode of Bluey\
is called Pirates.

-Yarrr!\
-Yarrr!

One day, there were three pirates.

Brave pirates.

Yarrr!

Greedy pirates!

Out in their boat,\
sailing along.

With our treasure!

With their treasure.

And the ocean was nice and calm.

Oh, this is okay.

Nice and --

Come on!

When suddenly,\
the wind started to blow!

Whoooo!

It's a storm!

-Yeaaaah!\
-Yeaaaah!

Whooo!

Missy! Come back!

As one of the pirates went\
and hung out behind a lighthouse --

which is fine.

But this was a chance\
for the little pirate

to be super brave!

She'll be super brave\
when she's ready.

For now,\
she's the lighthouse keeper.

You call this a storm?!

Whoa! I bet\
that'll get the sea angry!

-Roarrr!\
-The storm got bigger!

Aaaaah!

-Hold on, everyone!\
-Aaaah!

Oh, no! Me treasure!

Yaarghh!

Bingo!

Missy! We need you!

Oooooh!

Raaah!

Aaaah! Aaaah!

Bingo!

Gotcha!

Oh! And the brave pirate\
saved her greedy friend.

Me treasure!

And the ocean was calm again.

Phew!

Missy! The storm's over.

Yeah, it's all calm now.

Okay, here I come.

-Whoo!\
-Yay, Missy!

Oh! And the lighthouse keeper\
rejoined them.

When suddenly...

Something big hit the boat\
from underneath.

Which was the perfect chance\
for the little pirate

to show how brave she was.

-Ooof!\
- Aaaaah!

Missy, come back!

Unh-unh.

-Ooof!\
- Aaaah!

What's doing that?

It was an enormous blue whale,\
bumping into their boat!

-Boom! Boom!

Come on, Missy!\
This is fun!

But there's a blue whale on the loose!

I'm not scared of a silly blue whale!

Yeah, more like poo whale!

- Boom!\
-Aaah-ha-ha! Aaah!

Suddenly, the huge whale\
swallowed their boat whole!

-Raaahh!

Oh! Hold on, pirate!

-And then...

-...down the throat, they slid!

Right into\
the whale's belly!

It was all dark and slimy\
and gurgly and burgly!

But still pretty safe\
and kind of fun.

Who will save us?!

Maybe the lighthouse keeper\
is ready to help?

No way!

Aw, lighthouse keeper,\
it's nothing to be scared of.

Why did you stop\
making the whale noise?

Yeah!

Oh, um, the whale just went\
a bit quiet for a bit.

No, don't stop!

They're funny.

Mum, why isn't Dad\
making the whale noise?

Hmm.

Could it be this majestic blue whale

is embarrassed to be making funny noises

in front of another Daddy whale?

Well, that doesn't make any sense.

No, it doesn't make any sense.

Aw, come on!\
Come on!

Well, I'm sure the whale\
will be brave when he's ready.

Anyway, the pirates were still\
stuck in the whale's belly,

with no one to save them!

We're doomed!

Oh, wait a minute.

I know how you can get out\
of the whale belly.

Oh, but the pirates couldn't\
hear the lighthouse keeper.

They were stuck\
inside the usually noisy whale.

There was only one thing for it.

What?

The littlest pirate\
is going to have to

get swallowed by the whale, too.

Come on, Missy!\
You can do it!

I wanna spend me treasure!

Will she do it?

What's this?

Go, lighthouse keeper!

Oh, and she climbed up\
into the whale's mouth!

Almost there!

Go, lighthouse keeper!

Oh! And she slid\
right down its throat

and into its belly\
to join the others!

Ooof!

Yeah!

What bravery!

And what an inspiration\
to those of us out there

trying to face our fears!

What's your idea, Missy?

We tickle him!

Oh, yeah!

Tickle, tickle,\
tickle, tickle, tickle!

Hee hee.

Really?

Come on!\
Tickle harder!

Tickle, tickle!

-Hoo hoo, hee hee, ha ha.\
- Tickle, tickle, tickle...

-...tickle!\
-...tickle!

Come on, Mr. Blue Whale!

This is as hard\
as I can tickle.

Rooooar!

Ah! There he goes!

-Rooooar!\
-He rose up.

He was going to\
spit them out!

Pull us up, Bingo!

I don't have any spare arms!

-Well, drop your treasure!\
-Well, drop your treasure!

Ohh!

Yarrrr! Me treasure!

Thanks, Bingo.

-Rooooar!\
- Oh, boy.

The whale prepared\
to spit them out!

And the pirates landed safely\
back on their pirate ship!

Hooray! We did it!

And it was all thanks to the\
brave, little lighthouse keeper.

Whoo!

Phew!

And the big blue whale swam off\
to find his blue whale wife,

who loved him\
that little bit more now.

And off they sailed again,\
to look for more treasure.

Yarrrr!\
Treasure! 

# "Grannies" (Season 1 Episode 28)
Mum!

Dad!

Bingo!

- Bluey!

Eee! Eee! Eee!

Hey, Bingo,\
what are you doing?

Just flossing!

Great.

Do you wanna play Grannies?\
We can visit the shop.

Okay.\
Can I still floss?

Mm, no,\
I don't think grannies floss.

Yeah, they do.

Has this thing\
ever been cleaned?

Here come the grannies!

Uh-oh.

This episode of Bluey\
is called Grannies.

Make sure you pick up\
some beans for dinner, Rita.

What was that, Janet?

The shop's closed, Rita.

Pardon?

I said the shop's closed!

-Yeee!\
-Oww!

Don't worry about her, love.

-She's just looking for baked beans.

Hey!

Where are the beans?

Look, I think it's best if -- Ohh!

Janet! Wake up!

Ugh! Just having\
a nana nap, love.

I couldn't find\
any baked beans.

What have you got there?

Oh, nothin', dear.

Hey! You have to pay for those beans!

Run, Rita!

Aaah! Ohh!

I slipped on my beans!

Eee! Eee!

Bingo,\
you have to play properly.

You can only do\
what grannies do!

And grannies don't floss.

They do!

Mum, who's right --\
me or Bingo?

Uh...\
go ask your father.

-Oh, yeah!\
-Oh, yeah!

What are these kids eating?

Oh, what?

Uh, hey! Ooh-hoo!

Turn on the TV, Rita.

Okay, Janet.

-Ugh!

What are you kids doing?

Ah, it's that show\
about the big blue baboon!

Baboon?!

Change the channel!

-Blah! Blah!

Eee! Eee!

Bingo, stop it!

Dad, tell Bingo\
that grannies don't floss.

What are you kids on about?

We want to know --\
do grannies floss?

Do they?

How should I know?\
Go and ask your nana!

-Oh, yeah!\
-Oh, yeah!

Oh, hello?

Nana, down! Down!

Who's there?

- Aah!\
-Hang on.

Up, Nana! Up!

I can never work this thing!

-Ohh! I'm gonna take this thing back!

Back! Back!

Bob! Can you\
work this thing out?

-Nana!\
-Nana!

Oh, there ya go!

Hi, girls!

Nana, can you floss?

Oh, yes, Bingo.\
I floss every night.

-No, not your teeth.

The flossing dance!

This one --\
Eee! Eee! Eee!

Ohh?

Oh, my goodness!

Can I floss?

Well, I'll give it a go.

Woop, woop, woop!

Woop, woop, woop!

That's not it.

Oh, this is hard!

You've gotta give it\
some of these!

No, Bob,\
that's not it!

-No, it's not that, Nana.

Oh, look,\
you know, kids,

I don't think\
I can do the flossing.

Yeah, I was right!\
Oosh!

Is this right?

Nana!

Hey, I've got it!\
I've got it!

I'm doing it --\
Wahh! Oooh!

Oh, Bob!

See?\
Grannies can't floss.

Okay, Bingo,\
let's keep playing!

Bingo?

Bingo, do you still want to play?

No!

Just because I was right?

That's not fair, Bingo.

Hmph!

I hung out the washing\
yesterday. It's your turn.

No, I did it.\
I remember it distinctly.

Well, you're distinctly wrong.

Mum, I said that grannies can't floss,\
but Bingo said they can.

But I was right!

We rang Nana, and she couldn't floss.

But Bingo won't play with me.

I don't understand.

That makes two of us.

Why isn't she playing?

Well, love, you need\
to ask yourself a question.

-What?\
-Do you want to be right

or do you want Bingo to keep playing?

Hmm.

Can't I have both?

-No!\
-No!

I'm not gonna say\
that grannies can floss,

'cause they can't!

But I want to keep\
playing with Bingo.

What am I gonna do?

Wait! I know!

Oh! Hello, Bluey!

Nana, you're going to learn\
how to floss.

Oh, okay.

Let me get my glasses.

Your arms go like this.

All right.

The arms go up.

-Yeah -- no, not like that.

More like this,\
with your arms.

-Okay.\
-Yeah, yeah, that's it!

Just do this with your hips.

And I go like this?

Oh! I'm doing it!\
I'm doing it!

-Woop, woop! Woop, woop!\
-You're doing it, Nana!

You did it, Nana!

Bingo, look at this!

Look at this, Bingo!

Grannies can floss!

Yeah, I was wrong!

I knew it!

Thanks, Bluey!\
Thanks, Nana!

You're welcome, Bingo!

This never ends!

How about\
a lovely drive to the shops?

Okay, Janet.

Lovely day for a drive,\
wouldn't you say, Rita?

Sure is, Janet.

♪ I'm gonna put\
these wet clothes on the line ♪

-♪ Put these --

Ohh!

Did you hear something, Rita?

No, love.

Oh, you poor fella.

I've done my back.

Nice parking spot, Rita!

Thanks, Janet.

Eee! Eee! Eee! Eee!\
Eee! Eee!

Eee! Eee!\
Eee! Eee!

I hope we still floss at their age.

I think we will.

I think you're right.

-Eee! Eee! Eee! Eee!\
-Eee! Eee! Eee! Eee! 

# "The Creek" (Season 1 Episode 29)
Mum!

Dad!

Bingo!

- Bluey!

Rrr!

Dad, can you play with us?

Yeah, can you play with us,\
Bluey's Dad?

We're bored.

Bored? I thought you kids\
loved the playground.

We do, but we've played\
on all the swings already.

Well, play on 'em again.

Rrr!

Can you play with us now?

Okay. It's just that I'm a bit big

for all these swings, mate.

They're for kids.

What about we go\
to the creek, Bluey's Dad?

Uh...yeah, I'll take you\
down to the creek.

You squirts keen for that?

- Yay!\
-I think.

This episode of Bluey\
is called The Creek.

Ohh!

Waa!

How do you do that?

Dunno.\
You just balance.

Let's bush bash!

-Yay!\
-Yay!

Uh, actually...

I might just stay on\
the playground, if that's okay.

Come on, Bluey!

The creek is beautiful!

Maybe I should g--

Come on!

There sure are a lot of bushes.

Aah! Thorns!

Make sure you watch out for dropbears.

Dropbears?

Are you joking?

Yeah, yeah, I'm joking.

But seriously, watch out for snakes.

Ohhhh!

Aaah!

Aaaaaaaaah!

Hl-ll-ll-ll-ll-ll!

There sure are a lot of bugs\
at the creek.

Aaaaaah!

Tiny snake!

It's just a leech, kid.

Yoink!

Yeah, don't worry.

He just wants\
to eat your blood.

Maybe we should head back.

Not as many leeches\
in the playground.

Ooh, but there's not\
as many of those, either.

-Wow!\
-Oooh!

The ground here\
is more uneven

than in the playground.

Aaaah!

Ohh!

You all right, Bluey?

My knee!

Give us a look.

Oh, yeah.\
Okay.

I'll just have to\
chop the leg off.

Aaah! No!

What? You don't need two.

The creek!

Ooh! The creek is beautiful!

There's a nicer bit\
just up this way.

We used to play there\
when I was a kid.

-Let's rock-hop it up.

Aah!

Ehh...

Ohh!

Yeesh! Some of these stones are pointy.

Just take your time.

And watch out for wobbly ones.

Aah! This is a wobbly one!

Yeah, that's a wobbly one.

Ooh! Ooooooh!

Aaah!

Blegh!

And the green ones are slippery.

I swallowed mud!\
What can happen?!

Eh, it'll do you good.

Oh!

The creek is beautiful.

It's so lovely.

I'm not scared of it at all.

Ooh!

Heh!

Whoo!

Hey, I think I'm getting\
the hang of the creek.

Good one!

Nice job, Mackenzie!

Ready, Bingo?

Yep.

Whee!

Your turn, Bluey.

It's pretty wide!

Okay, on the count of three.

3, 2, 1...

go!

It's too far!

Come on, Bluey.

It's just like jumping\
from one sheep to another.

We don't jump on sheep, Mackenzie.

Really?

You'll be all right, kiddo.\
Just be brave.

The creek is...

beautiful!

-Hooray!\
-I did it!

Yeah! You made it, squirt!

Yeah, I did.

Here we are.

-Whoa!\
-Wow!

I don't think I've been here\
since I was your age.

Ah, it still looks the same.

So, what are we supposed to play?

Uh... dunno.\
It's the creek.

You just sort of muck around.

Ohhh, yeah!

Okay, but how do we --

Tadpoles!

Huh?

Look at the little fellas!

They're nibbling my toes!

Wow!

So beautiful.

Still want to head back\
to the playground, kiddo?

No, I like it here.

Whoa!

Whoo!

Ahhhh.\
So relaxing.

It's good of you to join us\
in our new day spa.

You're our very first customer.

Oh! It's a delight!

Do you like your nails,\
Bluey's Dad?

Oh, I do.\
They're amazing!

This mud pack will\
make you very beautiful.

Oh, thanks,\
Cassiopeia!

There you go.

Ooh!\
I'm out of mud.

Oh,\
I'll get some more.

I can feel\
my pores opening.

Aha!

The creek is beautiful.

Hey, look, gang.

You got the swings\
all to yourself.

Do you want one last go\
before we head home?

No, thanks, Dad.

Yeah, I'm a bit tired.

I didn't think\
you tired, Mackenzie.

Look! I can do it!\
I can do it!

Nice one, Bluey.

You didn't get\
any gazontapedes on you,

did you, Bingo?

Gazontapedes?

Are you joking?

Yeah, yeah.

Gazontapedes aren't real.

But seriously, we have to check for ticks.

# "Fairies" (Season 1 Episode 30)
Mum!

Dad!

Bingo!

- Bluey!

There.

Wackadoo!

Did you set up\
all those dominoes?

Yeah.\
It's for Dad.

It's a love heart.

Aww, 'cause you\
love your Dad.

Yeah.

I'm gonna let him knock\
over the first domino.

Dad, come with me!

Okay, hang on, kid.

-Come on!\
-I've just got to type this work e-mail.

- Come on, Dad!

-Bingo, let go, mate.

Hey, look, I'll just explain it. I just\
want to show you something. Come on!

Bingo, let go!

Sorry, sorry.

You need to give me four, not five.

No. Uh yeah, we've\
already got one of those.

Hey, kid. Have you seen Bingo?

Aah!\
Dad, your tail!

Huh? What?

It's been braided!

So's yours!

Aah!

Mine too!

-You know what this means?\
-What?

- We've got fairies!

This episode of Bluey\
is called Fairies.

I can't believe they're back.

All right. This is a fairy.

If you see one, whack it.

But they're\
invisible.

You have to look for fairies

with your heart.

My heart says\
they're under here!

Ah,\
it's just turps.

Maybe they've gone.

Aah!\
Bluey, your bottom!

-Aaah!\
-Aaah!

Aah! Mum!

You've got\
a peg beard!

Aaaah!

What are we gonna do?

That's it.

It's time to step this up a notch.

Let's do this.

Crab pots?

If they can catch crabs,\
they can catch fairies.

-Huh?

It's your phone.

Where's it gone?

Over there.

I'll get it!

Bluey! Stop!

Aaah!

I can't stop dancing!

-It's a fairy ring.

If you step inside,

you dance and dance\
until you drop!

Oh, no!

I'll see if I can\
knock her out with Bingo.

Yeah!\
Like marbles!

Yeah!

I can't stop dancing!

Why did I think\
that would work?

Bingo!\
Grab on!

Hooray!

Oh, no!\
Look!

We need a change of plan!

Let's call the police!

Your phone's in the fairy ring.

We need to give the fairies\
what they want.

Yeah, then they'll\
leave us alone.

What? I'm not rewarding\
naughty behavior.

Aah!\
Dad, your hands!

Huh?\
Aaah!

Little ratbags!

But what\
do the fairies want?

Maybe one of us hurt\
the fairies' feelings?

And now they're\
causing mischief.

Well, if that's true,\
how would this "one of us"

go about trying to fix things\
with "the fairies?"

Hmm.

Bingo, are you\
brave enough to go

and look for clues to\
what the fairies might want?

I am!

Aaah! Dad!

-Oh, Bandit, really?

It was the fairies!

Come on, Bluey.

Get 'em off!

I'm trying!

The fairies\
used a triple knot.

Bingo's been gone for ages.

Maybe she's\
found a clue.

Aah!

Come quickly!

-Ooh!\
-Whoa!

Look! It's a message\
from the fairies.

It's a picture of Dad\
dancing 'round our letterbox.

Hey, why have I got\
stink lines coming off me?

The fairies must think you stink.

-What?

I think they want you to fairy dance\
around our letterbox.

What?\
I'm not doin' that!

Dad!\
You have to!

No way.

Do your worst, fairies!

I'm not scared of you!

Eee!

Ha! See?\
Nothing.

Bingo!

Aaah! The fairies\
have frozen Bingo!

Because of you!

Curse you, fairies!

Well, you know\
what you have to do.

Oh, no.

I'll get the speaker!

Oh, man!

There's people everywhere!

Nice roller skates, Bandit!

This isn't about you.

You have to break\
the fairies' spell.

Okay, one thing first.

Hey, frozen Bingo.

If I've ever hurt your feelings,

I'm really sorry, mate.

Must feel really bad\
when your dad does that.

Just know that\
I love you, kid,

and I'd do anything for you.

Right.\
Let's do this!

-Yeah!\
-Yeah!

Go!

-Whoo!

-Yeah!\
-Yeah!

Go, Dad!\
You can do it!

I am the Lord of the Dance!

It's working!

Keep dancing!

-Don't stop!\
-Don't stop!

Is this what you want, fairies?!

Ooh!\
There's a hand!

Are you not entertained?!

Ohh...ohh...

Bingo!

Hooray!

Whoo!

Go, Bingo!

What a day!

Yeah, I'm glad the fairies\
got what they wanted.

Me too.

Ooh, can we\
play Spotlight?

Yep, go and get the torch.

Yeah!

Eee!

Hey, who set up my dominoes again?

Dad!

What is it, Bingo?

Look.

Oh, wow.

It's a love heart.

# "Work" (Season 1 Episode 31)
Mum!

Dad!

Bingo!

- Bluey!

Oh. Oh, hey.\
What's up?

We're here for the job interview.

Job interview?

We're playing Work.

Oh, Work.

- Oh, Work.

This episode of Bluey\
is called Work.

So, this is a dancing work,

where we do lots of dancing.

No. You make drainpipes.

Oh, okay.

Can it please be a dancing work?

No dancing.

Yes, boss.

No, you're the boss.

Hee hee hee!

Okay, so, we make drainpipes,\
and we're very busy.

Are you a hard worker?

Oh, definitely not.

Oh. Okay.

And what about you?

Ribbit!

Excuse me?

Ribbit!

Oh, she's a frog.

Oh, we've never hired\
a frog before.

But I've got a good\
feeling about you.

You're both hired!

Ribbit!

I said no dancing!

Ribbit.

I dreamt of running\
a dancing work once.

-Ahem!\
-Huh?

Oh, you can start right away.

Ribbit!

Why, thank you.

I'm sure I won't regret this.

How're we going?

I've finished four works already!

Excellent!\
Here's some dollarbucks.

And what about you?

Ribbit.

Ugh!

You have one, too.

Ring, ring, ring!

Now, keep going while\
I take this phone call.

Boop!\
Hello?

Yes, we do make drainpipes.

Uh, traditionally, they're round.

Ahh, so relaxing.

Ribbit.

Oh, this is the life.

Boop! I'm back.

-Hey!\
-Aah!

You were\
slacking off at work!

-I should f--\
-Ring, ring, ring!

Ah! This phone!

Boop!\
Hello? You did what?!

I got to\
duck out again.

Get back to work,\
and no slacking off!

Right,\
I'm in charge.

Frog Bingo,\
I'm going to need you

to throw all these papers\
on the floor, please.

Ribbit.

Ribbit!

Excellent work.

Now jump on them, please.

Ribbit, ribbit, ribbit!

Oh, and play this.

Ribbit, ribbit,

-ribbit, ribbit, ribbit...

Okay, I'm back.

Hey!\
What's going on?

Why is that frog\
jumping on my work?

And what are you doing\
in my chair?

I'm the boss now.

What?\
Says who?

Says this.

Well, this all looks\
in order then.

You have to do everything I say.

What?

Ugh, this chair\
is uncomfortable.

Worker,\
be my chair!

But -- But --

No buts.

Yes, boss.

This is not\
how you treat employees.

Chairs\
can't talk.

-Grr!

Now, clean\
those windows.

Uh-uh-uh!

Clean them with your bottom!

My bottom?

Do it!

Aah!

Now, once you've finished these ones,

you can...\
mop the floor with your tongue.

-Ohh.

Ugh, I hope that's gravy.

Ughh!

Ribbit, ribbit!

What are you doing?

-Stop that dancing!

You're gonna\
get us in trouble!

-What is the meaning of this?

Um, I was just,\
um --

You were dancing!

Um, yes,\
it was me.

I was dancing.

She had nothing\
to do with it.

I said no dancing.

Get out, and don't come back.

What? You mean you're firing me?

Please!

This job is my whole life!

Too bad!

-Rip!

Out!

Please!

I'll clean more stuff\
with my bottom!

Ow!

I love work.

Ribbit.

Would you like to buy a drainpipe?

Ruff!

Aw, peanuts!

Why are bad things happening to me?

I thought I was a good dog.

-Ribbit!\
-Oh!

Can I help you, little frog?

Ribbit.

Hey, little frog.

Do you want to buy a drainpipe?

Aw, no one\
wants my drainpipes.

How will I get dollarbucks?

Oh, dancing?

Well, I did always love dancing.

Ribbit!

Let's see if I've still got it.

Ribbit!

Oh, well. What have I got\
left to lose?

What's going on out here?

Hey, this guy's\
a pretty good dancer.

Hooray!

Ribbit!

Bravo!

I am Pavlova,\
the famous ballerina.

- It's her!\
-Ribbit!

My dance partner\
has sprained the ankle.

He is weak!

A little froggy told me\
I could find a new dancer here.

Ribbit!

You will dance\
with me tonight

at the Grand Theater!

Me?

-Him?\
-You!

-Ribbit!

This was your plan\
all along!

Ribbit, ribbit!

Thanks, little froggy.

Well?

I used to work with that guy.

Ribbit!

# "Bumpy_and_the_Wise_Old Wolfhound" (Season 1 Episode 32)
Mum!

Dad!

Bingo!

- Bluey!

Okay, take a big breath\
in for me, Bingo.

Ooh, that was\
a big one.

Can you ask her\
if I can go home?

Do you think we can\
go home soon, Doctor?

We might just\
keep you in

for another night,\
Bingo,

just to keep\
an eye on you.

I wanna go home.

I know, kid.

Me too.

It's not fair.

Yeah, I guess it isn't.

But here we are.

Oh, look.

Dad sent us a message.

It's a video!

Can I push play?

Yeah.\
Go on.

This story is called\
Bumpy and the Wise Old Wolfhound.

Hi! I'm Barnicus.

-It's Bluey!\
-Yeah!

Why is she wearing\
purple underpants?

Once, there was a young lady\
called Barnicus.

Barnicus!

What Barnicus wanted more\
than anything in the world

was a puppy!

I really want a puppy!

All day, she would say the same thing.

Here's your carrots, Barnicus.

These carrots are nice,

but what I really want\
is my very own puppy.

Maybe you should wish upon a star!

Okay.

Oh, twinkly star,\
please may I have a puppy?

Argh!

And then the next morning,\
she woke up...

Oh, my wish came true!

My very own puppy!

- Arghh!

I will call you Bumpy.

Hee hee, Bumpy!

Why is everyone wearing\
purple pants?

Barnicus and Bumpy\
went everywhere together.

I'll have some carrots,\
please, shopkeeper.

Bumpy loves carrots.

Oh, yes.\
What a lovely puppy!

Ow!

So gentle and mild!

-Owww!\
- Cut! Stop it!

-Oww!

Barnicus\
was finally happy.

Then, one day, Barnicus woke up\
to discover that Bumpy was very sick.

Oh, no!\
Bumpy's sick!

Lots of days and nights went by,

but Bumpy wasn't getting better.

It's not fair.

Barnicus wandered around\
looking for help...

-...but no one knew how to fix Socks --

Oh, I mean Bumpy.

Shopkeeper, please can you help Bumpy?

Sorry, I only know\
how to sell carrots.

Finally, she asked the baker.

Oh, no, Muffin.\
That's my good vase.

Hi, Bluey.

Did you want pancakes?

Muffin, her name is Barnicus!

Why don't...

-um...

Why don't you try\
the wise old Wolfhound, Barnicus?

Why don't you try the wise old\
Wolfhound, Bluey?

Barnicus!

I mean, Barnicus...?

Oh, yes, of course!

Thanks, baker lady!

Was that all right, Dad?

-Good luck, Bluey!

Oh, Muffin!

-We can edit that bit out, right?

Don't worry, Bumpy.

The wise old Wolfhound will\
be able to magic you better.

Hee hee!\
It's Aunt Trixie!

Oh, wise old Wolfhound,\
Bumpy is sick!

Oh, poor little fella.

It's not fair!

Please, can you help him?

I am not a puppy doctor.

Please, can you magic him better?

Magic?

Please, please, please!

Okay, little one.

Perhaps there is a way I can help.

Oh, wonderful!

Bring me a pair of purple underpants.

Okay!

Ah!

Now it's making sense.

Whoa! I'm not finished.

I need a pair of purple underpants

from someone who's never been sick.

Never been sick?

Never been sick.

Oh.

Have you ever been sick?

Oh, yes. I had\
a runny nose last year.

Well, it will have to be someone else's

purple underpants, I'm afraid.

No problems!

I'll get some from someone in town.

We'll be right back!

Good luck, Barnicus!

Shopkeeper,\
shopkeeper!

The wise old Wolfhound's\
gonna help my puppy!

I just need a pair\
of purple pants.

Sure! I'll give you anything\
if it helps Bumpy.

Hooray!

-Ewww!

Oh, dear.

There you go.

Thanks.

Wait. I forgot to ask.

Have you ever been sick?

Sick?

Oh. Well, yes.

I've got bum worms.

-Ewww!

-Good grief!

She can't use those pants.

Oh, okay.

Thanks anyway.

I'll have to try someone else.

Good luck!

And cut.

Baker lady,\
have you ever been sick?

Yes.\
I was sick yast lear.

-was sick yast lear.

-I was sick last week.

Oh.\
I had wabies.

- What?

Okay, no.

I can't use\
your purple pants.

Thanks, baker lady.

Bye, Bluey!

Barnicus!

Barnicus kept trying.

But she couldn't find\
a single person

that's never been sick.

Oh, I can't find a single\
pair of purple pants

from someone\
who's never been sick.

It's not fair.

And then...

Barnicus realized\
what the wise old Wolfhound

was trying to teach her.

Ohh.

Everyone gets sick\
sometimes,

not just Bumpy.

Being sick is just\
a part of life.

So from then on,\
Barnicus stopped thinking

that it wasn't fair\
that Bumpy was sick.

She read books to Bumpy,\
did coloring in,

and watched cartoons together

until one morning, she awoke

-to find Bumpy all better!

Hooray!

-Yeah!

The end.

See you tomorrow, Bingo!

Owww!

Socks!

Careful, Socks,\
he's got bum worms!

Again! 

# "Trampoline" (Season 1 Episode 33)
Mum!

Dad!

Bingo!

- Bluey!

Ahh! Ohh!

-Almost.\
-Ooh!

-Almost!\
-Come on, Bluey!

Almost! Got it!

-Yeah!\
-Yeah!

I reached it!

Alright, bumblenuts,\
I'm out of here.

- Nooo!\
-Yow!

I've gotta go to work!

No!\
No work!

Quick, Bingo, we need a plan.

How are we gonna\
get Dad to stay?

Think, Bingo, think.

Um, um...

My brain can't\
think of anything.

I know!

But, Dad, you can't leave\
without having breakfast!

Huh?

We were gonna make\
breakfast for you.

Yeah!

And you always say,\
you have to eat breakfast.

That is true.

I am always\
saying that.

-Okay.\
- Hooray!

This episode of Bluey\
is called Trampoline.

I'll just have\
some toast.

Hooray, toast!

I'll just get some bread.

Now, just bung these\
in the toaster.

Piece of bread one\
and piece of bread two.

-Ka-ching!

And now, just peruse\
my newspaper

and wait for my toast\
to be perfectly --

- Ka-chunk!

What?\
Toast is ready!

That wasn't very long.

Ugh!\
Nyum nyum nyum nyum!

This toast is raw!

Again, toaster!

No, no, no,\
I've really got to go.

No way!\
You have to have some...

Um, some...

Argh, I can't think!

-Juice!\
-Yeah, juice!

Juice! Juice!\
Juice! Juice!

Well, I do like a good juice.

-Hooray!\
-Hooray!

Mm-mm-mm-mm,\
mmm, mmm.

Now, what have we got\
in the fridge here for a juice?

Psst!\
What are you?

Oh, oh, uh,\
pineapple!

No, a blueberry.\
Black.

-A blackberry!\
-Got it.

What about you?

What fruit do you love?

Banana.

I'm a banana!

Banana and blueberries. Perfect!

-Blackberries!\
-Oh, blackberries.

Blackberries.\
Perfect!

Okay, let's just get them\
in the juicer.

Wait, what fruit\
do you hate?

Ooh, rockmelon.

Bleaghh!\
Hee hee!

I'm a rockmelon!

Yeah,\
and I'm a fly.

-Bzz, bzz!\
-Oh, no.

Okay,\
let's get the lid on.

Clunk!\
Now, switch the juicer on.

Okay, there we go.

Lid off.\
Let's have a taste!

Gulp gulp gulp gulp gulp!

Ahh!

Bleaghh!

Rockmelon and flies?!

Yuck!

Again -- juice!\
Again -- juice!

Nah, kids, that's it for me.

I've got to get to work.

No!

You need to have some...

-eggs!\
-Yeah!

Well, I am\
off the carbs.

-Hee hee! It's working!\
-It's working!

Okay.\
I'll have some eggs.

Hooray!

Quickly.

Okay, I just need to crack them\
in the frying pan.

Boing! Boing!

Ah ha ha!

That was an easy one.

One egg cracked.

Just need to crack the other one.

Ba-boom!\
Ba-boom!

This one has a tough shell.

Must be free range or something.

-Come...on...egg!

I want breakfast!

Ha!

There it goes.

Have us scrambled!

You got it.

Scramble scramble scramble,\
scrambleee!

Right.\
That's my brecky sorted.

Now I've gotta get\
to work, kids.

-No!\
-No!

Wait!

-Yaah!\
-Yaah!

-Get off!\
-Yaah!

You're not leaving!

Yes, I am!

Chilli!

Come on, kiddos.

You have to let Dad\
go to work.

-Aw!\
-Aw!

Sorry, kids.

I really do have to go.

Dad?

Yes, mate?

I don't want you to leave.

Come here, kid.

I want you to stay\
and play with us.

I know you do.

I have to go do my job, though.

And you have to do yours.

What? I don't have a job.

Yeah, you do.

Really? What is it?

Making up games.

Oh!

And making your bed,\
doing the dishes,

and setting the table!

But making up games is more\
important than you think.

Okay, Dad.

Bye, Dad.

Bluey, I don't know\
what to play.

I know.\
Come with me!

Ohh!

I'll kink the hose!

Aaaaah!

Good one, Bingo.

What's going to happen?

I don't know.

-Ready?\
-Yeah!

Unkink!

I know!\
We can be lettuce!

And this is\
a big salad spinner!

Yeah, getting washed,\
ready to eat!

That looks like a fun game.

Mum, come and have\
some salad for lunch!

We know how much you like salad.

-Yeah, alright.\
- Yeah!

Whoooaaa!

Whoa!

Who made up this game?

Me!

Nice job, Bluey!

# "The Dump" (Season 1 Episode 34)
Mum!

Dad!

Bingo!

- Bluey!

Dad, do you know everything?

Yep.

Bingo! Here, girl!

-Prove it.\
-Okay.

Bingo's about to run in\
and ask me where we're going.

Where are we going?

To the dump!

-Yeah! Dump!\
-Whoa!

This episode of\
Bluey is called The Dump.

Can we have a hairy\
monster attack on the way?

Maybe.

-Eeee!\
-Eeee!

What are we gonna dump\
at the dump, Dad?

Uh...\
just some old stuff.

I'm gonna play car rainbow on the way!

Red car!

Brown car!

Brown's not in the rainbow.

Oh, yeah.

I thought you said\
you knew everything.

I do.\
Ask me a question.

Okay.

Where was I before I was born?

Yeesh!\
Ask me another one.

-Can I drive the car?\
-Oh, that's easy.

-No.\
-Why?

You can't reach the pedals.

Oh, yeah.

Green car!

What if Bingo does the pedals\
and I drive the steering wheel?

Well, if a policeman caught you,

you'd have to pay\
100 dollarbucks.

He wouldn't catch us.\
We'd drive away really fast.

Police cars\
can drive faster.

But we have\
more petrol.

We can drive longer,\
and his car will stop.

Then he'd get in a helicopter.

Then we'd drive into a tunnel\
so he couldn't see us.

Then he'd land and get on a motorbike.

-They can go in tunnels.

But we get 10 red cars\
that look exactly like ours,

and they drive around us\
so he wouldn't know which one was us.

Who's driving all those other cars?

-Butlers.\
-Butlers?!

Where are you gonna get\
ten butlers from?

The Queen.

-We'd steal hers.

Well, yeah,\
that'd probably do it.

Hooray!

So, can we drive the car?

What do you want\
to drive the car for?

'Cause we like doing\
the squirty thing.

Can you push it?

But the windscreen's\
not dirty.

Please!

Bingo,\
double please face.

Oh, all right.

Yeah!

Again!

No, it's a waste\
of water.

Do it! Do it!

Hey!

Why'd you beep your horn?

Oh, that guy in the orange car\
isn't a very good driver.

Ooh! Orange car? Where?

Are you a good driver?

-Yep.\
-Are you the best driver in the world?

Yeah, probably.

Ooh, wow.

Red light!

So, did you know,\
Bluey --

Yellow car!

...um, that\
little chubby gnomes

climb up the traffic lights

and paint them\
red and green?

Ohh.

Ooh, what's that picture\
on the side of the bus?

It's an ad for a movie\
about superheroes.

Oooh!

Is that one a goodie or a baddie?

-A goodie.\
-Are you a goodie?

-Definitely.\
-What about me?

Well, it depends if you do\
good or bad things.

Um, I set the table\
and I do the dishes.

Are they good things?

Those are\
very good things.

The gnome is\
painting the light green.

But sometimes\
I ignore Bingo.

Well, you shouldn't\
ignore Bingo.

-Dad!\
-Do you say "Sorry"?

-Yeah.\
-Dad!

It's green!

-Then you're a goodie.\
-Hooray!

Why was that car\
beeping you?

Because the light was green!

Uh, yeah,\
I didn't see it change.

Are you not a very good driver, Dad?

Dad? Dad!

Are you not the best driver\
in the world?

I'm asking you a question.

Dad! Daad!

Daaad!

Yeah! Squirty thing!

You're the best dad in the world.

I am!

Purple car! Hooray!

See that sign, kids?

It says "the dump"!

Yay! The dump!

And... dump!

I love the dump.

Hey! Stop!

That's my drawing!

Oh, is it?

Aah! Those are all my drawings!

You're dumping my drawings!

Uh...well, you do\
a lot of drawings, kid.

She worked really hard\
on those drawings.

I know, but --

That's a picture of me.

You're throwing away\
Bluey!

You're a baddie.

Hey, Bluey, I've put\
your drawings back in the boot.

I'm sorry. We can keep 'em.

I don't think you are\
the best dad in the world.

Yeah, you're right, Bluey.\
I'm not.

Or the best driver.

And I don't know\
everything, either.

I was just being silly.

So you don't know where I was\
before I was born?

-Nuh.\
-Ohh.

You'll have to figure that out\
for yourself.

How do I do that?

I'm sure you'll work it out.

You figured out how to avoid\
capture by the police.

Yeah, I did.

But why were you\
dumping my drawings

in the stinky dump forever?

Well, I wasn't putting them\
in the stinky dump.

I was putting them in this dump.

Any drawings you throw in this dump

get mushed up and turned into new paper.

Ohh. Like brand-new bits of paper?

Yeah, so some other kid\
can draw a picture on it.

And what happens when\
that kid's dad throws it away?

Well, then it gets\
mushed up again

and turned into another\
piece of paper for another kid.

And over and over.

Oh, wow!

See?\
I know some stuff.

You can\
throw it away, Dad.

Oh. You sure?

Yeah.\
I can do another one.

Hwee!

Woosss!

-Hooray!\
-Good dumping, Dad!

I just need a pink car.

Please, everyone.\
It's the last one I need.

Okay, Bingo,\
I'll keep an eye out.

Me too.

Uh-oh! Uh-oh!

What is it?

Hairy monster attack!

Yeah!

Here it comes!

Yeah!

Get us\
out of here, Dad!

Okay! Vroom!

Hooray! Vroom!

Nice driving, Dad!

Dad, you know my drawing?

Yeah?

Was that someone else's\
drawing before it was mine?

Well, what do you think?

Yeah, I think so.

Bingo! Pink car!

Car rainbow!

Hooray!

You're the best dad in the world!

-Really?\
- Yeahh!

-Whoo! I'm back, baby! 

# "Zoo" (Season 1 Episode 35)
Mum!

Dad!

Bingo!

- Bluey!

Hey, Mum, can you\
play Zoo with us?

Bingo's gonna be\
Snowdrop the toddler.

And Mum's gonna be Mum!

Okay.

I'm gonna be zookeeper.

What about you, Dad?

I'll lie on the couch\
and read the paper.

No, we got a special job for you.

Uh-oh.

This episode of Bluey\
is called Zoo.

Good afternoon,\
Lady Gaberdine.

Welcome to the zoo.\
I'm the zookeeper.

Thank you.

My precious little Snowdrop\
just adores animals.

Animals! Animals!

How about I show you some of them?

Follow me.

This is a gentle giraffe.

He's very friendly.

Ooh! How delightful.

Giwaffe!

And if you follow me this way,\
you'll see our...

Kangawoo! Kangawoo!

Well, it's like a kangaroo,\
young lady, but smaller.

It's a pademelon.

Very friendly.

I'm pretty sure\
they like eating melons.

Boing, boing, boing!

Now, this next one\
is definitely not friendly.

He's a big, stinky baboon!

Ooh-ooh.

Big blue monkey!

Well, I rather thought

we'd see more movement\
from the animals.

Pbbbbht!

What a brute!

Stay back, Snowdrop!

Oi! Get up, you big ape!

Our visitors don't wanna see you\
lying around all day.

Ooh!

-What?!

Monkey sweep!\
Monkey sweep!

That's it!

-Oooooh!

Dance for the lady,\
you lazy ape!

-Aaah!

Ahhh!

Oh, my!

Monkey scratch butt-butt!

Ah, forget this guy.

Come on, let's go see\
the kookaburras.

Come along, Snowdrop!

Ooh-ooh ooh!\
Ooh! Ahhh!

Ahhhhh! Oo-oo-oooh!

Oooooh?

Ooh-ooh-ooh!

-Oooh!

-Big blue monkey!\
-Ooh-ooh!

These kookaburras\
think everything is funny.

Ooh! Look at these\
little darlings, Snowdrop.

Snowdrop?

Snowdrop want hug.

Snowdrop!

That gorilla has Snowdrop!

-Snowdrop hug monkey!

Ungh! That's it!

Don't worry, Madam!

I'll sort this out straightaway!

Ooh! You'll be careful\
with that, won't you?

He's not allowed to do this.

It's against the monkey rules.

Aaaaah!

Watch out for my darling Snowdrop!

Aaaaah!

Aaaaah!

Aaaaah!

Would you like to see\
our reptile section?

No!

Zookeeper, this is unheard of!

I demand you rescue\
my little Snowdrop at once!

Don't worry, Madam.\
Everything's under control.

Brr-brrr!

There you are!\
Ooh-ooh!

Come back here,\
you big ape!

This is not\
how you treat our visitors!

Snowdrop, darling!

Are you okay?

Everything's okay, Madam!

Feel free to check out our emus!

Brrm-brrm!

Ooh! Ooh!

Brrm-brmm-brrm!

Ooh! Ooh!

-Aaah! Aaah! Aaah!

Hey!\
Get back here, ape!

Snowdrop!

Would you like to visit our gift shop?

Hide in here, monkey!

Ooh! Ooh! Ooh!\
Eee! Eee! Eee!

Ooh?

Ooh! Ooh!

Me Snowdrop.\
You...

Ooh-ooh?

No, no.

Me Snowdrop.\
You...

Ooh-ooh?

You Ooh-ooh.

Snowdrop, Ooh-ooh.

Ooh-ooh.

That blue ape won't be able\
to resist this banana.

And when he goes for it,\
we'll trap him!

Well, I should say so!

Goodness knows, poor Snowdrop\
will be so worried without me.

Ahhh... Ooh-ooh!

Ahh... Ooh-ooh!

How long will this take?

- Ooh, ooh, ooh!\
-Ooh! I can hear them!

Ooh, ooh?

Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh!

Ooh-ooh!

Ooh, ooh, eee, eee!

No!

Aaaaah!

Settle down, ya big baboon!

Ooh-ooh!

Snowdrop!

I'll have to tickle\
the big fella to sleep!

Aaaaah!

Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh.

See?

Everything's under control.

You're a very lucky little girl,\
young lady.

No!\
Ooh-ooh!

Snowdrop!

Ooh-ooh!

Ooh-ooh!

Nighty-night, my little Snowdrop.

See Ooh-ooh tomorrow?

Goodness, no!

I don't think we'll go back\
to that zoo anytime soon.

Snowdrop miss Ooh-ooh.

Psst! Snowdrop!

You got a visitor.

Hey, come in here, you big baboon.

Oooh, oooh, oooh, eee, eee!

Ooh-ooh!

Oooh!

Ooh-ooh!

Ooh-ooh. 

# "Backpackers" (Season 1 Episode 36)
Mum!

Dad!

Bingo!

- Bluey!

What's this, Aunt Chilli?

It's a souvenir I got\
backpacking, Muffin.

It brings good luck.

It doesn't work.

Don't listen to him.

What's backpacking?

It's where you go on holiday

and you carry everything\
you own in big backpacks.

Can we play it?

Yeah!\
We can be the backpacks!

And Mum and Dad\
have to carry us around.

- Yeah!

I told you it doesn't work.

This episode of Bluey\
is called Backpackers.

Well, that was a pleasant\
two-day train ride.

Look!\
A whole new city to explore.

Bzzzzz!

Aaah!\
Get out of it!

What's with all these flies?

Man, these backpacks are so heavy.

Well, let's\
find a place to stay then.

Mum, you need to look\
in the guidebook for a hotel.

I need to look in the guidebook\
for a hotel.

-Right. Where's that guidebook?

It's in here somewhere.

Aha!

What is that?

I bought it from someone\
on the train.

She said it would bring good luck.

Ah, you ding-dong.

Aha!\
Here it is!

Don't let go, Bluey!

Right down...\
the bottom!

Got it!

I'll find us a nice hotel\
in the guidebook.

You're very hungry.

I'm very hungry.

Hey, look! Some guy's\
selling croissants.

I'll be right back.

Please don't eat too many.

Bonjour, mate.

Bonjour!

I'll take one croissant, please.

No, no.

You want all the croissants.

Aah.

I'll take all\
of your croissants, please.

How much?

Sixty hundred.

Okay, one sec.

Aha!

Here you go.

Huh?

Uh, do you take bananas?

Yes.

You do? Oh, what luck!

Oh, so good!

Namaste, mate.

Hello.

How much for you\
to take us to this hotel?

-Three hundred.\
-No!

The guidebook says one hundred.

That's a good price.

No, no, no!\
Three hundred!

Ready to roll?

He wants three hundred!

Ask him if he takes bananas.

Bingo, give Uncle Bandit a tummy ache.

Okay.

Aaah!\
My stomach!

I need the toilet.

Pay him whatever he wants!

I know how this ends!

Croissants!

I told you not to eat too many.

But they were so cheap!

I hope it's not too far.

You want to stop\
and take a picture.

Hang on, driver!

I wanna stop\
and take a picture.

Agh, come on!

Ooh,\
look at that temple.

Oh, great.\
Another temple photo.

Now, where's my camera?

Ah, here it is.\
Oh.

Why did you bring\
a potato masher

instead of a camera?

I don't really have\
a good explanation.

This hotel we're going to looks lovely.

The toilet better work!

This is where you get off.

Ooh!\
This is where we get off.

Finally!

Thanks, mate.

Here's your money.

What?

You're really thirsty.

I'm really thirsty.

I'll just get my water bottle,\
which is full of water.

Where's that water bottle?

Ah, here it is.

Hey! It's empty!

How did that happen?

No thanks. I'm fine.\
No thanks.

You can't find\
the hotel.

I can't find the hotel!

I really need to get\
to a toilet.

Just stay focused,\
and don't get distracted.

No thanks. Ooh!

Yes, I would like to look\
at your beads.

Sacré bleu!

Bingo, tummy ache!

Mama Mia!

I need to sit down\
against this tree.

That's better.

-Bzzzzz!\
- Get these flies away!

I think we're lost.

Oh, what?

You need the toilet right now!

Let's just stay there.

-Are you sure?\
-Positive.

Buon giorno! Come sta?

I'd like a room where\
the toilet's inside that room.

Passports.

You need our passports?

Hang on.\
They're in my backpack.

Yow! Sorry, mate!

Jeremy! No!

I ate too many croissants.

I can't find the passports!

Oh, wunderbar!

Can you check my backpack?

Bluey,\
are these passports?

Yeah, they're little books\
with your picture in them.

They're the most important thing\
when you're backpacking,

so we can't ever let them find them.

Yeah, ever.

Okay, Bluey.

-Got that, Socks?\
-Aaah!

Where are those passports?

I'll check my front pack.

They must be here somewhere!

Give them here, Bingo!

Check my backpack.

Why'd you bring the toilet brush?

That's it.\
Empty the backpacks!

No passports here.

Hey! Come on, lucky souvenir thing!

Pleeease let our passports\
be in here!

Aa-aa-aa-aa-aa-aah!

-Yeah!\
-Yeah!

Passports.

Looks like this thing worked.

Now who's the ding-dong?

Feeling better?

Incroyable!

Ahhh! It's good not having\
those backpacks on.

This place\
is all right.

Yeah.

And it's not even in the guidebook.

Hey!

It's time for\
your mountain hike.

It's time for our mountain hike.

-You ready?\
-Sure am.

Let's go!

These... new...\
hiking boots...

are good...\
aren't... they?

Yep.

So... light...

I can... hardly... feel them! 

# "The Adventure" (Season 1 Episode 37)
Mum!

Dad!

Bingo!

- Bluey!

Oh, another electricity bill.

How will I afford to feed\
all these babies?

Princess?

Yes, Kindly Queen?

I'm afraid you're gonna have\
to leave home

and find food for us all.

But I'm much too scared\
to travel in the outside world.

Please, don't make me leave!

I'm sorry, you have to,\
or we'll all starve.

I'll miss you ever so much!

As will I, Kindly Queen.

Waah, waah!

Oh, Honeyhorse, my oldest friend.

Whatever shall we do?

Wherever shall we go?

Great idea!

We will travel to the farm\
where I was born.

They will have plenty of food\
for everyone!

Hooray!

Honeyhorse can't talk, remember?\
He just neighs.

-Oh, yeah.

This episode of Bluey\
is called The Adventure.

Oh, my, Honeyhorse,\
I'm not sure about this.

-Hut!\
-Aah!

Oh, my,\
what rude fellows.

Oh, my, what rude fellows!

Stop copying me this instant.

Stop copying me this instant.

Dah, silly terriers!

Boys are strong\
like King Kong!

Girls are weak!\
Chuck 'em in the creek!

-Huh!

Pbht! Chloe, let me be\
the princess for a second.

-I've got an idea.\
-Okay.

Ahem!

Huh?

Girls are strong like King Kong.

Boys are weak.

Chuck them in the creek!

You've beaten us, my princess.

When you need us, we'll be there.

Why, thank you.

Neeeigh!

We're here!

This is the farm where I grew up.

It will have lots of food\
for the Kindly Queen's babies.

Oh, my! It's all gone!

This was once full of fruit bushes.

What's happened?

The Greedy Queen

turned it all to sand, my dear princess.

Grandma Fairy, it's you!

Yes, it's me!

Why did the greedy Queen turn\
all the fruit bushes into sand?

Maybe she really likes sand.

Someone has to stop her,\
or there'll be no food!

-What about you?\
-Me?

I'm not brave enough.

You are, too!

You have the heart of a hero, my princess.

Here, take this treasure.

It's really magic.

It can help you beat the Greedy Queen.

I'm sorry.\
I'm just too frightened.

I have to ride home at once!

Honeyhorse, where are you?

Ha-ha-ha-haaa!

I'm the Greedy Queen,\
and I'm going to freeze you!

-Freeze!\
-Aah!

Ha-ha-ha-haaa!

Honeyhorse!

Oh, no! Honeyhorse,\
my dearest friend!

The Greedy Queen has\
turned you to stone.

Well, I'm gonna make her\
turn you back to not-stone!

The Greedy Queen has frozen\
all the villagers!

And I'll freeze you, too!

-Freeze!\
-Waah!

You can't hide\
from me, dearie!

I am too powerful\
for a little princess.

If you keep being mean\
and greedy,

no one will want to be your friend!

I don't want any friends!

I like being mean and greedy.

Oh, I'm not brave enough to do this.

-Yaaah!\
-Aah! Help!

No one can help you now!

You want to bet?!

-Yaaah!

Argh!\
Get away, you stinky boys!

Run, princess!

Aaaaah!

Thank you, brave ones!

Protect the princess!

Freeze! Freeze! Freeze!

-Yaaah!

-I'm coming to get you!

Oh, no!

You're a faster\
runner than me, Bluey!

-Let's swap.\
- Okay.

Yaaah!

Ha-ha-ha-haaa!

Oh, there's no way across!

I'm doooooomed!

-Princess!\
-Huh?

Fairy Grandma!

Oh, my dearie, you have to\
stand up to that Greedy Queen

or you'll be\
frozen forever.

No, but I can't.

I'm just a scared little princess.

But you don't have to be.

You can change\
into anything you want.

Can I?

Yes, you can.

I have to go now, my child.

Wait, no!

Remember the treasuuuure!

Treasure, treasure, treasure...

Ohh.

Haha, there you are!

Ohhhh!

Thought you could get away\
from me, did you?

Ha-ha-ha-haaa!

Turn Honeyhorse back\
to not-stone, or else!

Or else what, my little princess?

Or else I'll turn you to stone!

Ha! Oh my!

I'd like to see that!

Ha-ha-ha-haaa!

Ooh, I'm scared!

-Go get it!\
-Wah!

Pah!

Uh, whoops!

Yeah!

You did it, princess!

You beat the Greedy Queen!

Oh, Honeyhorse,\
my dearest friend.

We did it!

Hooray!

More tea and cakes\
for your children, Kindly Queen?

Oh, they couldn't eat another bite,

thanks to you, brave princess.

What'd you get up to\
at school today, Chloe?

Um...not much.

Bluey and I played princesses.

Oh, princesses, eh?

Oh, is that where you sit in\
a castle and have tea and cakes?

-Freeze!\
-Aah!

# "Copycat" (Season 1 Episode 38)
Mum!

Dad!

Bingo!

- Bluey!

Oh, man.

Oh, man.

-Huh?\
-Huh?

Are you copying me?

Are you copying me?

-Oh, boy.\
-Oh, boy.

This episode of Bluey\
is called Copycat.

-Ohh!\
-Oh!

Ha!

Hoo, huh, ha, hoo, heh,\
bl-l-l-oh!

Awoo! Ha!

Glurble, glurble, glargh!

Aaaaah!

I am Bluey, and I stink\
like a monkey's butt.

I am Bluey, and I stink\
like a monkey's butt.

Well, good that we can agree\
on that, then.

Time for my morning walk.

Time for my\
morning walk.

I like to walk really far!

And I like to walk like this!

Like those guys\
in the Olympics.

-A-doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo!

Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo,\
doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo!

Morning, Wendy!

Do you know I like to smack\
my bum as hard as I can?

Ooh! Oww!

Ooh! Aah!

Ungh! Unh!

Aah! Ow!

Ooh! Aah! Ow!

Unh! Aah!

Where were you\
on that one?

Where were you on that one?

-Grrr!\
-Raarr!

Stop copying me!

Hey Dad, stop.

It's a bird!

But it's\
on the ground.

It's a little budgie.

Is it okay?

Hmm...no,\
it looks hurt.

-What do we do?\
-We'd better get him some help.

-Here, come here --

-Ow!\
-Ooh!

He nipped me!\
Toughen up, Bandit!

He's scared.

Bluey, run inside and get\
a shoe box and a tea towel

to make a little bed\
for him.

Okay.

Um, which one?

Big Ben or Outback?

Hurry up, Bluey!

Outback.

Come here.

Ooh, be careful!

He's as light as a feather.

There you go, little mate.

Warm and toasty.

What do we do now?

We got to the vet.

Are birds meant to drive in cars?

No, they usually fly.

What if the seatbelt\
doesn't fit?

Don't worry, I know just what to do.

You're a good seatbelt, Dad.

-Thanks.

It's green, mate!\
Get off your phone!

-Aah! Keep being a seatbelt!\
-Oh!

Watch out for cars.

Excuse me, we found this little fella.

I think a cat might have got to him.

Oh, thank you.

Come here, little one.

I'll get him to our vet.

Good luck, little mate.

Blap.

Will the budgie be okay?

I don't know.\
He looked pretty knocked around.

I hope he is.

I'm sorry.

It's bad news, I'm afraid.

The little budgie died.

Oh. Okay.

Aw, sorry, kiddo.

Come here.

-Dad?\
-Yes, mate?

I don't want the budgie\
to have died.

I know. Me neither.

But there's nothing we can do.

It's out of our hands.

Are you sure\
he won't get better?

Yeah, I'm sure.

Oh, Bluey.

♪ Dee, doo, doo, doo,\
dee, doo, dee-doo-doo ♪

-Bingo?\
-Yeah?

Can you pretend\
to be a budgie?

Okay.

Tweet, tweet!

Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo\
doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo.

Tweet! Tweet!

Oh, g'day,\
little fella.

You look hurt.

We best get you some help.

Bingo, you have to\
nip me.

-Okay.\
-Ow! Bingo!

-That wasn't a nip!

That was a chomp!

Rrreee!

Toughen up, Bluey.

I'll get you\
a shoe box.

Tweet, tweet!\
Tweeet!

Come on,\
little mate.

-Oh!

Light...\
as a...feather!

-Ooh!\
-Tweet!

-Rrreee!

There you go,\
little mate.

You'll be nice\
and toasty in here.

Tweet!

Now let's\
get you to the vet!

-Aaaah!\
-Tweeeet!

-It's green, mate!

Put your phone call away!

Rrreee! Rrreee!

Oooooooo-ooh!

Tweet! Tweet!\
Tweet!

-Aaaah!\
-Ouch!

Rrreee!

Got to watch out\
for cars.

There... you... go!

Rrrreee!

Hello, dear.\
What seems to be the matter?

I think a cat beat this feller up.

Oh, goodness, come here.

Take a seat.

I'll take him\
to see our vet.

Good luck,\
little mate.

I hope the poor little\
budgie's okay.

I'm pretty sure\
he won't be.

I've got good news!

Your bird is okay.

Oh, no, no, Mum, you have\
to pretend it's bad news --

that the budgie's dead.

Oh.\
Are you sure?

Yeah, I'm sure.

Okay, um, I have bad news.

Oh, did the budgie die?

I'm afraid she did.

Oh. Okay.

Rrreee! Rrreee!\
Rrrreee!

Bingo, what are you doing?

You're not supposed to be better!

Hmm, we probably should\
have told the budgie.

-Hey!\
-Rrreee! Rrreee! Rrreee!

-Tweet! Tweet!

Rrrreee!\
Rrreee! Rrreee!

Rrreee! Rrreee!

This isn't how you wanted\
the game to go, is it?

No.

That's okay.

There's nothing we can do.

It's out of our hands.

Hey, Bluey, I've just realized.

You stopped copying me!

Oh, yeah!

Tweet!

What is Bingo doing?

Would you like\
some chip-- Hey!

Chippies!

And take your time.

Your friend looks like\

You ruined\
my game!

You can't\
play with us!

You're being mean!

Okay, okay,\
calm down, children.

Let's get\
to the bottom of this.

Rusty, tell me\
your side of the story.

Okay, Calypso.

I was walking along\
to Cozy Corner...

Hello,\
doctor ladies.

Do you sell\
crutches?

[all] Aah!

...and they all went crazy!

They just started\
yelling at me.

Oh, that's odd.

Yeah.

Bluey, what's your side of the story?

Well, we were playing doctors\
in a baby hospital.

Next!

[Bluey] We were delivering\
everyone's babies for them.

Ooh,\
here comes your baby!

I've got a wet flannel.

Pop! It's a baby boy!

Thanks!\
I'll call him Max.

Congratulations. Next!

Ooh, that's me.

Indy wanted to play early baby,\
like her sister in real life.

Bluey, can we pretend\
my baby is coming,

but it's coming too early?

Oh, okay.

Doctor, I think\
my baby is coming!

Oh, great!

But isn't it meant\
to come this afternoon?

Yes, it must be early!

[all gasping] Early baby!

[Bluey] This episode of Bluey\
is called Early Baby.

I'm a bit worried.

Everything's gonna be fine, Indy.

I've got\
a wet flannel.

Here it comes! Pop!

[all] Hooray!

It's a boy!

No, it's a girl.

I mean, it's a girl!

Hello.

I'm calling her Polly.

Great!\
Okay, who's next?

No, Bluey!

Because Polly's\
an early baby,

she needs to stay\
in the hospital for a long time,

'cause she's\
still very small.

Oh, oh, okay.

We can take care of her.

I can use my wet flannel!

Thanks, but before you\
touch her,

you have to wash\
your hands with soap.

Got it.

This is where you wash\
your hands, everyone.

Yeah.

But we need to put her\
in, uh...

it's like a fish tank\
with holes in it.

Aha!

What about this?

Yes!

I'll put Polly in for you.

Uh uh uh!\
You need to wash your hands.

Oh, yeah!

I forgot.

There you go, Polly.

She likes reading lights.

Great.\
Now what, Indy?

Mums aren't allowed\
to stay at night,

so you need to tell me\
to go home to sleep.

Oh, okay.

But I'll pretend that\
I don't want to leave Polly.

Got it.

Okay now, sweetheart,\
we'll look after her.

But I don't want\
to leave Polly!

You have to be the bravest\
you've ever been.

Okay, I'll be the bravest\
I've ever been.

Goodnight, Polly.

Raaaah!

It's okay, Indy.

We'll take good care of her.

She's asleep!

Hello, doctor ladies.

Do you sell crutches?

[all] Aah!

Ohh, I see.

I'm sorry, Indy.

I didn't know Polly\
was your early baby.

That's okay, Rusty.

You can play with us if you want.

Great.

You just have to follow\
the rules of their game.

Yeah, come on.

-Okay.\
-[laughter]

Oh, um,\
before you all go,

can I ask a question?

[all] Sure!

Rusty, why were you\
looking for crutches?

Oh!

Well, Coco and I

were building\
a castle out of blocks...

Rahh!

...when a huge dragon came.

Arrr!\
Arrr!

Aah! The dragon's back!

Run, everybody!

Every day, he would come\
to take one villager to eat.

Go away, dragon!

Rahh!

Give me a villager,\
or I'll breathe fire

on your whole town!

Oh, my. What shall we do?

The townsfolk\
had no choice.

They gave a villager\
to the dragon.

[all gasp]

To decide\
who it would be,

they played\
"Ip Dip Sky Blue."

Ip dip sky blue.\
Who's it? Not you.

Not because you're dirty,\
not because you're clean.

My mum says\
you're the fairy queen!

They chose\
the king's daughter!

"Oh, no!

I'm so upset!

I'll give my castle\
to whoever takes her place."

But no one would.

But the king's daughter\
was very brave.

She said to the king,\
"Goodbye, father.

We both have to be\
the bravest we've ever been."

No!

Hooray!

Rahh!

"Oh, my only daughter is gone!\
Who will bring her back to me?"

I will, Your Majesty.

I'm a knight.

[gasps]\
Aren't you scared?

Yes, Your Majesty, but I will be\
the bravest I've ever been.

So the knight set off.

Goodnight, Polly.

Rahh!\
Rahh!

Yeah!

Sausage dragon!

I command you to free\
the king's daughter!

Never!

I'll eat her now!

Hey.\
Use this instead.

It looks more like a daughter.

-Okay.\
-Rahh!

Put her down!

You can't stop me!

So the knight\
fought the sausage dragon

with all his might.

Rrr!\
[grunting]

-Rahh!\
-Yeah!

And the brave knight\
won...

Aah!

...and rescued\
the king's daughter.

You're safe now.

But the brave\
knight was hurt very bad.

I need to get\
to a hostable.

Oh!\
There's one over there.

Thanks.

Hello,\
doctor ladies.

Do you sell crutches?

[all] Aah!

Ohhh!

Let's play Knights and Dragons!

[all] Yeah!

[both giggle]

I said, "I'm off to work."

But I'm off to work.

I think it might be good

if you two played apart\
for a little bit.

Rusty, why don't you go and play\
Mums and Dads with Bluey,

and Indy, you play\
with Mackenzie in the sandpit.

Okay.

I'm never playing\
Mums and Dads with you again!

Well, I'm not playing Mums\
and Dads with you ever again.

-Hmph!\
-Hmph!

We'll see.

[Rusty] This episode of Bluey\
is called Mums and Dads.

Hi, Mackenzie.

I'm gonna play\
Mums and Dads with you,

because I'm never\
playing with Rusty again.

[Mackenzie]\
Sounds good.

What are you doing?

I'm digging a hole to the\
bottom of the sandpit.

Ooh,\
can Polly and I help?

Sure.

Rusty would never do\
something this fun.

-[thud!]\
-Aah! I hit the bottom!

What's there?!

Green plastic?

Okay, well...

Now it's time\
for Polly's lunch.

Let's dig\
another one!

-What?\
-Mackenzie!

Hmph.

Can I play Mums and Dads\
with you, Bluey?

Sure.

Great,\
'cause I'm never playing

Mums and Dads\
with Indy again.

I'll be the Mum.

Great.\
I'll just fix this --

-Gotcha!\
-[grunts] Hey!

Time for your bottle, baby!

Aaah! What are you doing?

Playing Mums and Dads.\
You're my baby.

[high-pitched]\
Baby want milky treats?

Aaaah!

Awoo-woo-woo-woo-woo!

Snickers, you don't like\
digging holes, do you?

Not with these little\
sausage-dog arms.

Great.\
Let's play Mums and Dads.

Okay.

Polly is our baby,\
and I need to get to work, so --

-Tag!\
-Aah!

You're it, Snickers!\
I'm gonna get you!

Snickers!

♪ Hush, little baby,\
don't you cry ♪

♪ Mummy's going to\
sing you a lullaby ♪

Bluey!\
I don't want to be the baby!

I want to be the Daaad!

[sniffs] Whoo!\
Someone's stinky!

What?\
Time to change your nappy!

Nooooo!

[jowls flapping]

Winton,\
if we play Mums and Dads,

will you pinky-promise\
to do everything I say?

Yes!\
I'm a very obedient breed.

Great.\
Here's Polly.

I'm off to work.

Uh, hello.

[humming]

Right, now to get\
some work done.

Tap, tap, tap, tap,\
tap, tap, tap, tap.

Winton!

I don't know what to do.

You have to get Polly to sleep.

How?

Just rock her back and forth!

No! Like this.

There, she's asleep.

Now what do I do?

You take her home\
and put her in the cot.

Okay.

Where do I live?

Uuuugh!

Here comes the airplane!

[high-pitched]\
Aw, does baby not like

his nummy-nummy?

[normal voice]\
Oh, good boy!

Hey, Terrier.

You're playing Mums and Dads with me.

Oh, okay.

I do have to do this\
one thing, though.

Make sure you give her\
some tummy time.

All right.

Are you ready to storm the castle?

Uh, I think so.

Baby loves his walkies!

Pah!

Oh, cheeky baby,\
spitting your dummy out.

Don't worry,\
we'll -- Hey!

Runaway baby!

[sighs] Finally,\
I can get some work done.

Tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap.

I wonder what Polly's up to.

Yeah!

[indistinct shouting]

[grunting]

Tap, tap, tap,\
tap, tap, tap, tap, tap --

[screams]

Ohhh!

I don't understand what's\
so difficult about this!

Aaah!

Someone stop that baby!

Good Polly.

Rusty would never take you\
to raid a castle.

Indy, you have to help me!

Bluey's gone crazy!

I need to hide!

Oh, okay.

Um... I know!

Baby! Baby!

Winton, have you seen my baby?

No, sorry.

Aw!

-I'll be your baby.\
-Hooray!

[Bluey] Time for\
your bottle, baby!

I think she's gone.

Thanks, Indy.

Hello, Polly.

Good to see you again.

Oh!\
Green plastic.

I'm sorry I yelled at you, Rusty.

I'm sorry I yelled at you.

Should we play\
Mums and Dads again?

Yes, please.

I like the bonnet.

Ugh!

Indy, I think mums can go to work.

Yeah, so can dads, if they want.

So...how about you go to work,\
and I'll look after Polly.

No, it's okay.

No, I really don't mind.

No, I really don't mind.

Well, someone has to go to work.

What do we got to do?

[both] What if it's the weekend?

Yeah!

She's asleep now!

Great. I think\
the sink's broken again.

Oh, okay.

I'll fix it.

Thanks, Rusty!

I want to hear all about\

[as Polly] Oh, yes,\
it was wonderful!

[normal voice] Would you like\
milk with your tea?

[as Polly]\
Oh, yes, please!

There you go, Polly.

And what about you, Gerald?

Chattermax, this is a tea party,\

No!

[as Polly] I'm so sorry about my husband!

Aah, stop! Stop!

Hi.

Tu veux jouer avec moi?

Huh?

Est-ce qu'on joue ensemble?

I'm not really sure\

His tent's not there.

Oh, yes, I saw them packing up.

What?

They must have left\
early this morning.

You mean they're gone?

I'm afraid so, sweetheart.

[insects chirping]

[Bingo] Mum, I need a wee.

[Mum] Okay, let's do a bush wee.

Where's the bunny night light?

Here it is.

[Dad] Moooor!

Do you need a wee, too, Bluey?

[Bluey] No, but can I come anyway?

The more the merrier.

[urinating]

Mum?

Yeah?

Why did Jean Luc have to go?

Their holiday was over, honey.

But I want to keep playing with him.

He was my friend.

Well, look.

Sometimes, special people\
come into our lives,

stay for a bit,\
and then they have to go.

But that's sad.

It is.

But the bit where they were here\
was happy, wasn't it?

Yeah.

We caught a wild pig together.

Maybe that makes it all worth it.

Will I ever see him again?

Well, you never know.

The world's a magical place.

Finished.

Oooh, stars.

Ahhh.

What a day!

Cut us down, kids.

-Yeah!\
-Yeah!

-Chop, chop, chop!\
-Chop, chop, chop!

-Timber!

Five minutes till bed, kids.

And five years till the\
next trip to Crazyworld.

Can we play a game?

As long as it's one\
where I don't have to move

any part of my body or say anything\
with my mouth.

Okay.

Hey, Bingo!\
Let's make it that

Mum and Dad are a mountain!

Yeah!

Mount Mumandad!

This episode of\
Bluey is called Mount Mumandad.

We can have a race to the top!

Whoever plants their\
flag first wins.

Ready?

Go!

Wait!\
I'm gonna get climbing stuff.

Bingo, we only have five minutes!

Don't start without me!

All packed.

Ready, set, go!

Wait! I forgot the music box.

Bingo!

That's it, I'm starting.

Ready!

Hey, you didn't wait for me.

You were taking ages!

I was packing important mountain stuff.

Grr!

Ooh!

Aaah!

Eeeh. This is hard!

Your backpack's too heavy,\
that's why!

But it's got\
all my climbing stuff

and my map\
of Mount Mumandad.

Hmm.

Yes, I'm going the right way.

Oh, Bingo.

Oooh! This is a nice view.

Eww!

This bit of the mountain stinks.

I'm gonna win, Bingo!

Click, photo, click, photo...

Bingo, what are you doing?

We're racing!

Click, photo.\
Ooh, yeah! Hee hee!

Ooh, this is gonna be a bit tricky.

-Aaah!\
-Ohh!

Aaaaaaaah!\
Ohh!

Help! I'm slipping!

I can't hold on!

Help, Bingo!

I'm coming!

Don't worry!\
I've got some rope in my backpack.

Grab on!

Ooh!

I got you, Bluey! Hold on!

Ohh, ohh!

Phew! Thanks, Bingo.

That's okay.

But I'm still gonna win!

Huh!

Bluey!

-Yaah! Ooof!

Ooh, it's steep here.

Eeek!\
So slippery!

Bingo, can I just use your head

to give me a little boost?

-Hey!\
- Aah!

Oop! Sorry!

Oof. Bluey!

I'm gonna win, Bingo!

It's not fair, Bluey!

You cheated!

No, I didn't!

Yes... you... did!

No... I... didn't!

Yes... you... did!

No... I...

didn't!

Aah!

-Ehh! Ohh!

Uh-oh.\
Aaaah!

Dad, stop it!

Oh, no! It's an avalanche!

Grooowwww!\
Grr!

Grr!

-Grr!\
-Aaaah!

Ooof!

Are you okay, Bluey?

I'm fine.

A silly little\
avalanche isn't gonna stop me.

Aah! Bluey, there's the storm!

Dad, stop it!

Bluey, come back down.

It's not worth it.

No, I'm almost there!

Aaaah!

Ooof!

Bluey, come in my tent.

No, I have to get to the top!

But the storm is too strong.

Aaaah! Oof!

Dad!

Aaaah!\
Aaaaah!

What a cheeky Old Man Mountain.

Ooh, I like your tent, Bingo.

Thanks.

Oh, you'll need this.

Ooh, that's better.

Nice and toasty.

We can play London Snap\
till the storm passes.

Okay.

Black cab.

Trafalgar.

Furry hat guy.

Buckingham Palace.

Buckingham Palace.

-Snap!\
- Ow!

And then rabbit ran off really fast,

leaving behind the slow tortoise.

Hurry up, tortoise!

Yeah, hurry up!

You have to beat that cheeky rabbit!

The storm's still going.

What should we do?

We'll have to stay in the tent longer.

We can watch the ballerina spin around.

I'm sorry I cheated, Bingo.

That's okay.

I'm a cheeky rabbit sometimes.

I think I'm more like the slow tortoise.

Bingo, I think the storm is stopping!

The mountain's quiet.

Come on.\
Let's go!

Okay!

Shhh!

We don't want to disturb Old Man Mountain.

You do not climb Mount Mumandad\
by trying to race ahead on your own,

or by competing with your comrades.

You do it slowly and carefully by\
unselfish teamwork.

That is the mountain way.

- Ow!

me or Bingo?

Favorite?

Keeping in mind\
I can run the fastest.

Yeah, but I can whistle.

See?

So who?

You're both my favorites.

But I can kick my own bum.

Watch! Hunh!

Look, kid, parents\
don't pick favorites.

Why not?

They just don't.

One, two...

Ehh!

All right, let's hit this\
hard and quick.

Sound good, kids?

Ooh!

Hey, Bingo, let's play Kids!

Yeah!

Oh, not Kids!

This episode of Bluey\
is called Kids.

Okay, Bingo, you're a toddler\
and your name is Snowdrop.

And I'll be your Mum.

Okay, Mama!

And you're Snowdrop's older brother.

And your name is...

Hee hee.\
...Diddums.

Diddums?!

I'll take that, Diddums!

Are you ready to go shopping, Snowdrop?

Yeah, Mama.

Unh, unh, unh!

Mum's in charge\
of the trolley, Diddums.

Children use those ones.

Oh, Mum!

Oof!

No dilly-dallying, Diddums!

Yes, Mum!

Chocolate or pink, Snowdrop?

Both!

Okay, my sweetie.

Snowdrop loves\
chocolate milk!

Mama, Mama!\
Diddums being sneaky!

Diddums!\
How very dare you!

And who said you could have\
all that green stuff?

Please, Mum.\
Can't we get some vegetables?

Of course not. Do you think\
I'm made of money?

Well, how come\
Snowdrop gets chocolate milk?

Because she's so cute!

What?!

-Now, put them back!

Ohh!

G'day, Bandit.\
How's it going?

Hey, Roko.\
Don't ask.

What's going on, Diddums?!

Lollygagging with your friends again?

Mum! You're embarrassing me!

Back to the trolley\
this instant, young man.

Yes, Mum.

See ya, Roko.

Oh, hello, Roko.

How's your mother?

She's good, Mrs. Heeler.

Honestly, Diddums,\
I can't believe --

Oh! Who threw this\
on the ground?

Diddums!

What?!\
It wasn't me!

It was Snowdrop!

Snowdrop would never do such a thing!

This isn't fair!\
You always take her side!

That's because Snowdrop is an angel\
and you're a very naughty boy.

Huh! Well, I'm a naughty boy, am I?

Yes. You are a very naughty boy.

Naughty boy!

Okay, then.

-Grr!\
-Hey!

-Naughty boy! Naughty boy!\
-Diddums!

Come back this instant!

-Naughty boy!\
-Flaxseeds, pepitas...

almond flour --\
yes, please!

Stop it,\
Diddums!

You will do what your mother says!

No!\
I'm a naughty boy!

Diddums!

Walnuts, psyllium husks,\
sugar-free chocolate --

don't mind if I do!

Stop!

Put that back!

No!

Ooh, hoo, hoo! You wait till\
your father hears about this!

Pbbbbht!

Ugh!

I'm going to count\
to three, Diddums!

One...

two...

two and a half...

That's it!

Heh, heh, heh!

You have to bend down.

Oh, okay.

-You're going to time out, young man.\
-Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow!

Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow!

Now, you sit\
in that toilet-paper chair

and have a good think\
about what you've done.

Toilet-paper chair?!

This isn't fair, Mum!

Why doesn't Snowdrop\
have to go to time out?

She's the one\
who's being cheeky.

Because she's my favorite.

You mean Snowdrop's\
really your favorite?

Yes. Snowdrop is my favorite.

Oh. I-I see.

I'll just sit here\
until you tell me I can come out.

Well, um...yes.

Good.

- Hee hee hee.

Can I help you?

I wish you could, mate.

-Hee hee!

No cards today, sweetie.\
Put them back. Come on.

No!\
Snowdrop want cards!

Maybe that's enough time\
in the toilet-paper chair

for your brother, I think.

Come on, Snowdrop.

Stinky Mummy!

Nyeh, nyeh,\
nyeh, nyeh!

Snowdrop!

Pbbbbbht!

You are a cheeky toddler!

Hee hee!

Personally, I can't go back to single-ply.

No, that's madness.

See ya, mate.

You can come out now, Diddums.

Oh, good, 'cause this is\
actually embarrassing.

You were right.

It was Snowdrop being cheeky all along.

I'm sorry\
I didn't believe you...

and that I said\
she was my favorite.

I love you, Mum.

Diddums, can I put you\
in charge of the trolley?

Yes, Mum.

'Cause I got a cheeky toddler\

We'll have to cook the chickenrat egg\
in the morning, Bingo.

This is the second time\
I've said bedtime!

What on Earth have you done\
to your father?

[Dad] Ah-choo!

[Bluey] This episode of Bluey\
is called Chickenrat.

I can't find Floppy anywhere.

Okay.\
Keep calm.

Let's retrace your steps.

When did you last have him?

I don't know.

Okay.

What did you do\
before you got ready for bed?

I don't know!

Um, we were on the balcony.

We were making a fire\
to cook the chickenrat egg.

Psheww! Fire!

Dad's gonna love this egg.

Ooh!\
That reminds me.

We better turn him back into a dog.

[Mum] Okay, kids, bedtime!

Oh, Mum!

Then we came in here.

Righto.\
Let's check the balcony.

[insects chirping]

No sign of Floppy.

Ohhh!

What did you do\
before you made the campfire?

Um, we took Chickenrat\
into the bathroom...

[giggles]\
...to lay an egg.

-Come on, Chickenrat.\
-[clucking]

Time to lay your egg!

Bawk, bawk,\

-Brrk!

Let's go and cook it\
on the balcony!

Okay.

Bawk, bawk,\
bawk, bawk.

Then we came here.

Okay. Let's check\
the bathroom.

I was wondering why my clean towels\
were all over the floor.

Floppy's not here.

Where were you before you brought\
Chickenrat into the bathroom?

Hmm. Hallway.

Yeah, Dad was hiding.

[burp]

Aha!

Ah, that sauerkraut!

Chickenrat!\
Pchew!

Bawk!

Brrk, brrk, brrk,\
brrk, brrk...

-It worked!\
-Yes!

Now we just need him\
to lay an egg.

Hmm.\
We need a nest.

How about the laundry basket?

Yeah!

Come on, Chickenrat.\
Come on.

Brrk, brrk, brrk...

Floppy's not here.

Before we turned Dad\
into a chickenrat,

we were at...

the couch!

Chickenrat!\
Peww!

-Yah! You won't get me!\
-[both giggle]

-[rapid footsteps]\
-He went up the stairs!

[both giggle]

Hmm. Not here.

Where were you before the living room?

Hmmm.

We were at the dress-up box,

dressing up as ninjas.

No Floppy here.

Where were we before\
we dressed up as ninjas?

In the backyard!

Getting the magic wand!

We used this magic wand\
to turn Dad into a chickenrat!

And then he can lay\
a chickenrat egg for us.

Yeah!

We're going to need\
to sneak up on him, though.

Let's dress up as ninjas!

Yeah!

Hmm. No Floppy.

Where were we\
before we were out here?

The fridge!

Checking to see if we had\
any chickenrat eggs.

Hmm. We've got\
normal chicken eggs.

But no chickenrat eggs.

Where do chickenrat eggs\
even come from?

Mummy chickenrats,\
I suppose.

So we just need\
a Mummy chickenrat.

I've got an idea!

Let's get my magic wand\
from the backyard.

Hmm.\
No Floppy here.

Before the kitchen?

The shop!

Hello, Chef.

The customer has ordered\
one chickenrat egg.

What's a chickenrat?

It's half chicken\
and half rat.

We don't even have\
one chickenrat egg.

Oh! Let's check\
the fridge!

No Floppy here.

Okay, before we were here,

I was back\
at the couch...

taking Dad's order.

Good morning, customer.

[burp]

What can I get you\
for breakfast?

Oh. Um...

I'll have an egg, please.

Certainly.

That won't take long.

Ah, hang on.

Not a normal egg.

I want a chickenrat egg.

What's a chickenrat?

It's a cross\
between a chicken and a rat.

Hmm. Okay.

I'll just check with the chef.

Take your time.

Ohh!

I'm sorry, Bingo.

We've already searched here,\
and it's getting late.

We'll have to look for Floppy\
in the morning.

Ohh! Floppy's\
gone forever.

It's okay, Bingo.

She's probably\
just hiding somewhere.

Hiding?

Ah! I know where Floppy is!

I know where Floppy is!

Where?

[laughs]

[toy squeaks]

[all] Floppy!

[laughter]

What was she doing\
in the chickenrat egg?

Well...

we were having lunch...

I'm so hungry!

I could eat everyone at this table!

Quick, Floppy!

You need to hide from Daddy\
before he eats you!

You'll be safe in here.

Oh, maybe I'll just\
have some sauerkraut instead.

But mum says you can't eat sauerkraut

Yeah, it makes you burp.

I know, but it's so good!

[giggles]

Dad, can you be our customer\
for Restaurant?

Not until I've laid on the couch

and read every section\
of the newspaper.

Dad would love to be\
your customer, kids.

Come on, Bingo.\
You and me can play.

Yeah!

[burp]

Well, that was an adventure.

Night, Mum.

Night, Mum.

Night, Bluey.

Verandah Santa first.

Okay.

-Time for bed, kids!

It's Christmas in the morning!

Hooray! Christmas!

And that means\
Verandah Santa's coming tonight!

Hooray!

Now, he only gives presents\
to nice kids who are fast asleep.

Night, Dad!

So, no peeking, or no presents.

Ho, ho, ho!

Oh! Was that a peek?

No, no!\
I'm still asleep.

It wasn't a peek!

It better not have been!

Ho, ho, and ho.

Wake up, kids!\
It's Christmas!

Hooray!

See if Verandah Santa\
left you anything!

I got a snow globe.

I got shaving cream.

I got a pencil case.

-Hey, that's my pencil case!\
-Hey!

Dad!

Bingo, no snatching, thanks.

But it's mine!

It's just Bluey's for the game.\
She'll give it back after.

Okay.\
I'm sorry, Bluey.

Well done, Bingo.

I don't want it.

Dad, I said "Sorry,"\
but she isn't taking the pencil case.

Are you gonna accept\
her "Sorry," Bluey?

No. Why should I?

Because Santa won't bring you\
any presents.

Santa likes children\
who accept "Sorries."

Okay, fine!

Oh. That was easy.

Okay. Someone else's turn\
to be Verandah Santa!

Get off!

Oh, yeah!

Get off!

Night-night, kids.

No peeking, or no presents.

We won't!

-Ho, ho, ho!

Huh? What?

Naughty children!

You peeked at Santa!

We didn't mean to!

You woke us up!

No presents for you!

What?!

What a stitch-up!

I'm gonna throw these in the bin!

No!

We're sorry, Santa.

We're so...

so, so sorry.

Please, will you accept our "Sorry"?

Hmm.

Yes, I will.

Yeah! Yeah! Hooray!

Thanks, Verandah Santa!

Boy, I sure am\
a very nice child!

Huh?

If I were a real Santa,\
I'd give me lots of presents.

I'm not sure that's how it works.

-My turn!

Ooh! You can be\
my helper, Socks.

Ruff, ruff, ruff!

Night-night, children.

No waking up!

Yes, Mum!

Ho, ho, ho.

Ah. My teddy bear!

Let go,\
you cheeky child!

Oh, my teddy bear.

Oh, my teddy bear!

Ow! Socks!

Dad, Socks bit me!

Socks, listen,\
we don't bite people, okay?

That's not nice.

It wasn't even an accident!

It was on purpose for no reason!

Well, look,\
I've told her off, Bluey.

But she's not even saying "Sorry"!

She's only 1.\
She doesn't know any better yet.

We have to teach her.

Look, let's just\
keep playing, okay.

Hmph! Fine!

-Okay.

Who wants to be Verandah Santa?

Me.

Strap yourselves in, kids.

Ho!

Pillow!

-Aaah!\
-Where's my pillow?

Ho...

Where's my blanket?

...ho...

...ho...

No.

Christmas!

Hooray!

Ruff!

Look under your pillows

to see if Verandah Santa\
brought you anything.

Underpants!

One of these!

Baked beans!

What's under your pillow, Socks?

Ruff!

Oh, I guess Verandah Santa

doesn't give presents\
to kids who bite people.

Bluey!

She bit me!

Whee!

Bluey, I think you should\
say "Sorry" to Socks.

I didn't do anything wrong!

I was teaching her that Santa\
doesn't give you presents

if you're not nice.

-Bluey, don't worry about

whether Santa's gonna bring you\
presents or not, okay?

Why?

'Cause it's not the reason\
to be nice to people.

Well, then, what's the reason?

Come with us.

Oh.

That's the reason.

Imagine if Socks did to you\
what you did to her.

Hi, Socks.

I'm sorry I didn't\
give you any presents.

I was mad at you\
'cause you bit me

and you didn't say "Sorry."

Okay, night, kids!

That's enough sinister plotting.

Night-night!

Ho, ho --

Whoa, no!

Get him!

Verandah Santa's\
just trying to do his job!

You naughty kids!

# "Dance Mode" (Season 2 Episode 1)
Excuse me?

Yes, over here.\
Ooh, I need brown.

Oops.

Oh, yes.\
Can we get the bill, please?

♪ Oh! Can we get the bill?! ♪

Bluey, inside voice.

♪ Oh\
Can we get the bill? ♪

Is Bingo gonna eat that chip?

Uh, no, I think she's finished.

Scab!

There.

Hey, where's my chip?

Dad ate it.

What?

I was saving that chippy.

I know. I said I was sorry, kid.

It's my fault.

I thought you'd finished.

I was still very hungry.

How can we make it up to you, Bingo?

Yeah, name your price.

Oh, I know!

Eee! Dance mode!

Oh, not dance mode.

This episode of Bluey\
is called Dance Mode.

Eee, I'm so excited!\
Me too!

Right, you get three dance modes,\
Bingo, and then that's it.

OK.

Green dog. Come on.

Bingo, music.\
Shall we put Mum in dance mode?

Um, yes, OK.

I'll do it.

Dance mode!

Quick, let's bail, kids.

She's not with us!

Bandit!

Whoo! Shake it, Chilli!

Morning, Wendy.

Ooh!\
That was so funny.

You still got it, babe.\
You'll get yours.

Bluey, the next dance mode is going\
to be mine to choose one, OK?

Not you.\
OK.

Are you gonna use your dance mode\
in here, Bingo?

No, I wanna save it\
for somewhere special.

Plus, there's no music here.

Oh, yeah.\
Ah, what a shame.

Next, please. How can I help?

I just need to change\
the address on this.

OK, I'll need to see\
two forms of ID, please.

Two? Oh, hang on.\
Let me have a look.

Ooh, music!

Bingo, can I please use\
dance mode on your dad?

Oh, well it's just...

Pretty please?

Um, OK. Yes.

Oh, thank you, thank you, thank you!

Well, I've got my gym card.\
It's sort of got my picture on it.

Uh, no, I can't use\
a gym card, mate.

Oh, no!

Dance mode!\
Ah!

Uh, are you OK?

I'm fine. Just ignore this.

Now, what about my library card?

Oh, I'm sorry, we can only accept...

Look, if you could\
just stop dancing for a moment...

I would if I could, mate.

Hey, twinkle toes, hurry up!

That was glorious!

Uh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

When are you gonna use\
your last dance mode, Bingo?

Last one? But I haven't even\
used my first one yet.

What's that noise?

Uh, let's, um...go this way instead.\
Yeah, hang on.

Come on, come on, come on!\
Nothing to see up there.

Oh, look.

Whoo! Shake it!

Shake your tails.

He's playing music with thongs.

Wow.

Is this a good place\
for your dance mode?

Ooh, yeah.\
Do it, Bingo.

Dance mo...\
Whoa, hang on.

Yeah, hang on.\
Hey!

Look, uh, you seem like\
you've cheered up, Bingo.

Maybe we can forget\
about that last dance mode.

Oh, what?!\
No fair!

OK, look, I'm gonna buy\
your last dance mode off you

for, uh, 10...no, no, 20 bucks.

Bandit, no!

Whoa, 20 dollarbucks?!\
You could buy a Yes/No button.

Yeah, yeah, a Yes/No button.\
That thing sounds good.

Please, Bingo?

Pretty please?

Uh...OK.

Hooray!

Let's go!

Phew.\
This is not good parenting.

Ooh, here it is.

Look, Bingo.

You push this...\
Yes!

And if you push this one...

No.\
Hee-hee-hee.

What do you think? Do you want it?\
Yeah? Should we get it?

Uh...OK.

Hooray!

No, no, no, no, no...\
Well, that all worked out.

Didn't it, kids?\
Yes!

Yes, yes...

Yes, yes, yes...

Oh, Bingo, what's up?

You wanna tell us\
what's the matter, honey?

Do you not like your Yes/No button?

No.\
But you said you wanted it!

Bluey, inside voice!

But she said she wanted it.\
So, why is she upset?

Is it because people keep taking\
things from you without asking?

Yes.\
I thought so.

Like when I took your last chip?\
Yes.

And I took one of your dance modes?\
Yes.

Well, I took one too, but I asked.

We all asked. And she said yes.

Didn't you, Bingo?

Yes.

See?

So, what are we meant to do, then?

This is confusing.

Bingo, sometimes,\
does your outside voice say yes

when your inside voice\
really means no?

Oh, yeah, like this.

I'm sorry, Bingo.\
Me too.

Yeah, me too.

Can you think of a way\
that we can make it up to you?

Whoa, hang on.

Yes.

Hey! Hey, hey!

This is gonna be fun!

Oh, boy.

Are you ready, Bingo?

This seems to happen to us a lot.

Just dance like no-one's watching.

Ready?

Ladies and gentlemen,\
I'm doing this for my kid.

Dance mode!\
Whoo!

Yeah!

Here we go!

Yes, yes, yes, yes...

Whoo! Yeah!

Let's take this to the mat.

Who likes to dance?!

(THEME MUSIC)

Waa!

Ohh.

That's no good.

This house is falling apart.

Well, nothing lasts forever.

Yeah, I guess.

It's just got character.

Dad, Bingo's watermelon\
is redder than mine.

No, it isn't.

Yeah, it is. See?

Oh, yeah.

Well, the grass is always greener\
on the other side of the fence.

What does that mean?

Hey, Bandit!

Check it out.

New pizza oven.

Pretty sweet, eh?

I just got it from Hammerbarn.

BOTH: Ooh.

We're going to Hammerbarn.

BOTH: Yeah, Hammerbarn!

Gee, his lawn's looking green.

This episode of Bluey\
is called Hammerbarn.

Will the pizza taste better\
from the pizza oven?

Yep.

Nope.

Dad, Bluey got more sauce than me.

No, she didn't.

Hey, mate,\
where are your pizza ovens?

Aisle 300. Left at the fake grass.

If you hit a flamingo,\
you've gone too far.

BOTH: Trolley!

I'm going to aisle 300.

OK, we'll head to the garden centre.

Come on, kids.

Oop.

Ooh, Bingo, these can be our houses.

Yeah.

This is my yard and that's yours.

Yeah!

(HUMS)

Ooh.

Hey, Bingo, look. I've got a garden.

Yeah, me too.

Can't have too many of these?

Ooh, you can be my husband.

Hey, no fair. I want a husband too.

Yes, yes, here you go.

Same as Bingo.

Hee-hee-hee. Hello, husband.

Hello, my name is Hecuba.

Oh, hello, Hecuba.

My name's Gerald.

I'm going to do some yard work.

Dig-dig-dig.

Dig-dig-dig-dig.

Hey, Gerald doesn't have a shovel.

Mum, Bingo's husband\
is better than mine.

Just try and be happy\
with what you've got, OK?

I can't be happy with what I've got\
when what she has is better.

Here.\
Thanks, Mum.

Hello, new husband.

What a lovely veggie patch, Hecuba.

Fairy lights.

Ooh.

Hey, why does Bingo...

And more fairy lights\
that are just the same.

Thank you.

These can be our pizza ovens.

BOTH: Cook-cook-cook-cook-cook.

Ooh, look, Hecuba, a pizza flipper.

Cook-cook-cook-flip.

Cook-cook-cook-flip.

Mum, can we get two\
pizza flippers, please?

We don't need two.

Try swapping something with Bingo.

Cook-cook-cook.

Bingo, will you swap some\
of my plants for your pizza flipper?

No, thanks.

Flip.

What about for my husband?

No, thanks.

Flip.

Oh, but that pizza flipper\
is all I want in the whole world.

OK.

Thanks, Bingo.

Hee-hee-hee.

Cook-cook-cook-flip.

Cook-cook-cook-flip.

Ooh, pizza stone.

Ohhh.

A dining table.

Ohh.

I'll swap you back the pizza flipper\
for your dining table.

No way.

Bingo!

I want a turn with it.

Hey.\
Give it to me.

Oweee.

Let go, Bingo.

Give it to me, Bluey.

(GASPS)

So how many BTU's has this one got?

(YELLING) Bluey!

Ah, it's probably another Bluey.

I'm sorry.

This is what happens when\
you're unhappy with what you've got.

Someone's husband\
eventually gets it.

I just wanted the dining room table.

You can't just get\
new stuff all the time.

Why not?

Because stuff costs money.

There's no magical place\
where everything's just free.

Bluey, look.

(GASPS)

It's everything we want.

Are these all for free?

Yes, they're all for free.

BOTH: Hooray!

Hmm, Gerald, I'll put olives\
on your half, my dear.

Sharralanda, darling,\
you wouldn't have some lettuce

I could borrow, would you?

Of course, Rhonda.

Here you go.

Thanks, darling.

I'm just enjoying this hamburger.

Poor Hecuba,\
he always loved hamburgers.

Would you like to try some beetroot?

Oh, thank you, darling.

Isn't it nice having everything?

Yes, it is.

Just try not to get used to it, OK?

Oh, it's that lady who said\
we can't have everything we want.

Don't listen to her, Rhonda.

Oh, that pizza was delicious.\
(BEEPING)

Hey, why have we stopped?

And what's that dooting?

Hey!\
Oh, my plants.

What are you doing?

Hi, guys. I have to scan\
all your stuff, OK?

(GASPS)

BOTH: We're at the checkout!

Ahh! My pizza oven.

Give it back.

No.

Don't take my dining table.

We have to pay for it.

Gerald!

Bluey, relax.

She's taking my husband.

Ah, I might meet you in the car.

We worked so hard on our houses.

I wasn't ready to take them down.

I know.

I guess nothing lasts forever.

Hey, would you kids\
like to try my beeper gun?

Yes, please.

Here you go.

(BEEP!)

(SQUEALS)\
(BEEP!)

Can I have a turn?

Yeah, here you go.

(BEEP!)\
(GIGGLES)

OK, kids, are you ready for the best\
pizza you've ever tasted?

BOTH: Yeah.

We'll see about that.

Ta-da!

Looks a bit bodgy.

No, it's just got character.

Tuck in, kids.

I'm just going to give one\
to Lucky's dad.

Hey, yours is bigger than mine.

But that's fine.

Hey, mate, have a go at this.

Ham and pineapple.

Aw, yeah,\
swap you for a meatlover's.

Nice.

Oh, my goodness.

BOTH: What is it?

This is amazing!

Hooray!

# "Featherwand" (Season 2 Episode 3)
Cellophane! Ooh, everything's red.

I chose Chutney Chimp\
wrapping paper,

because Chloe's birthday party\
is a Chutney Chimp party.

Nice one. Present done.\
Now go get ready.

Yeah!\
Yeah!

Oh, ah, Bingo, not you.

I'm sorry, honey, but you're not\
invited to Chloe's party, remember?

Only Bluey is.

You mean, I miss out?

I'm afraid so, honey.

It's 'cause Chloe's turning seven\
and she's only inviting seven people.

Oh.

You'll stay here with Dad,\
OK, honey?

Aw! OK.\
That's the girl.

Dad, can you make us breakfast\
while we get ready?

Si. Don't worry, Bingo,\
we'll make our own fun.

is called Featherwand.

Bluey, do you want cereal?

Yeah, you want cereal.

Cereal, heavy!\
Huh?

I said, "Cereal heavy."

Oh! What's going on?

This is some heavy cereal.

Must have a lot of fibre.

OK, Twenty...six...

What's wrong, Bandit?

You used to be able to lift spoons.

Nothing. Eat your floor cereal.

Something weird is going on.

Yeah, tell me about it.\

Whoa! Ooh.\

She's got a Featherwand.\
Get her!

She's trying to stop us\
from getting to Chloe's party.

Argh! Look out!

I didn't think\
it would end like this.

We need a new plan!

You mean, we get the present\

Yeah, while bugalugs here\

Good plan.\
Argh!

Go, go, go.

Don't look back!

You don't mind missing out\

No. I made my own fun.

OK, let's go.

Do we have to?

Huh?\
I think I wanna stay.

You don't want to go\
to Chloe's party?

I do, but I just don't wanna miss\
out on playing Featherwand either.

Well, this is a pickle.

Yeah, Bingo, when you\
make your own fun,

you certainly make your own fun.

What are we going to do?

It's OK, Bluey, you won't miss out.

When you get back we can...

Ooh, OK.

Squash.

I'm going to pound you!\
Yeah, right.

What can we play while you squash?

Um, well, you can still control us.

BOTH: Hooray!\
Here. This can be the controller.

I'll control Dad! He always wins.

Take that!

Ohh.\
Aw.

Hoo!

Ha! (PANTS)

Something's wrong with this.

Ohh!\
Yeah!

Yah!

Yah! Ohh!

Why do you keep losing?

Because big brothers\
always beat little brothers.

Aww.

OK, one more point and we win,\
Bluey.

Make it happen.

OK!

(PANTS)

Just do your best, Bingo.

I'm trying, but my controller\

it's the controller, kid.

This isn't over.

Argh!

Oof!

(CHEERS)

Yeah!

Now it's over.

Aww.

I didn't even win once.

Big sisters always beat\
little sisters.

That's just the way it goes.

I'm going to the bubbler.

Oh, Bingo.

Let's go again!\
(PANTS) Yep.

Just...just let me get a drink.

(PANTS)

Nice controlling, kid.

Dad, can you please let Uncle Stripe\
win the next squash?

What? Why?

'Cause I don't think Bingo's\
having any fun.

Aw, you're such a good big sister.

So, can you?\
Nope!

What?! Why not?

That's not how grownups work, kid.\
But it's how kids work!

Then kids are silly.

What?! How very dare you!

(SING-SONG) Nyah nyah-nyah nyah-nyah\
nyah. Kids are silly.

That is it! I'm going to\
make you lose the next squash.

What?! No!

I take it back!\
Kids aren't silly!

Please don't make me lose!

Too late.

(GURGLING)

What are you doing, Bingo?

I'm fixing you.\
Fixing me?

Yeah!

This is the antenna bit\
that makes the controller work.

Oh! Is it not working properly?

No.

You're not doing what\
I'm controlling you to do

and Bluey keeps beating me.

Aw. Look, I'm sorry, Bingo.

Maybe you guys should swap\
for the next game?

No. I want to control you.

Are you sure?

You'll probably have a better chance\
of winning with your dad.

No, I want US to win.

Oh, really? Why's that?

Because big sisters\
don't always beat little sisters.

There! I fixed you.

Yeah, Bingo.

You did.

Oh, please! Don't make me lose!

I'll give you a hundred\
chocolate koalas.

Nope!

You ready?\
Argh!

Bingo, it's your turn to control me\

Nope!

Please!

Oh. Have I found MY voice?

Yes, you have!

Now you need to find your ears.

(GIGGLES) Here they are!

Bluey!

Hello, ladies.

Ooh! Another customer.

Welcome to the hairdressers'.

Do you have a...um...um...

An appointment.\
Yes. That thing.

Well, of course.

The name's Bert - Bert Handsome.

Ah, yes. Please, um...

Take a seat.\
Yes. What she said.

(QUIETLY) See? I'm helping!

Hello, there.\
Ooh!

Uh... Hello.

Now, what can we do for you\
today, Bert?

Well, just make me look\
more handsome -

if that's even possible.

(GIGGLES) OK.

Snip, snip, snip.

So, please, tell me\
what you've been up to.

Oh, well, I just bought a new house,\
because I have SO much money

and my last house was too small

to fit in all the trophies I'd won\
for being SO handsome!

(BINGO GIGGLES)

And I also...\
Wait a minute.

What is it?

Aagh! A nit!\
Huh?

You've got nits!\
What?!

He's got nits!

Aagh! Nits!\
Get down!

Aaagh!

This episode of Bluey\
is now called Nits.

Are you sure it's not just dandruff?

Don't move!\
Aah!

Bluey, maybe we could, um...

..um...um...

I don't actually have a big house!

..um...um...

Come on, Bingo! This is an emergency!

(SOBBING) I live with my mum!

We could...

Oh, yeah! The shower!

So now what do I do?

Turn on the tap!

Um, OK.

Uh, I'll do it nice and warm.

Uh, no. Um, it has to be, um...um...

It has to be a COLD shower!\
Yes!

What?!

Nits hate cold showers.

(GIGGLES)

But...but...

Do it.

Oh, well... I guess\
you're the experts.

Aaagh!

(BOTH LAUGH)\
Aaaagh-ha-ho! Aagh!

(BOTH LAUGH)\
Aagh! Ah-ha! Eeagh! Aagh!

Aaagh! Aagh!

Phew!

OK, kids. That's it for the nits.

Get the stragglers!\
Aagh-ha-haagh!

Get 'em!\
Ow! Yaagh!

There's one!\
Ow!

There's the other!\
Oww!

They're all over his butt!\
Ow!

He's got butt nits!\
Aaagh!

What are we gonna do, Bingo?

Let's get the...um...

Oh, yeah!

Nit bird!

(WHACKING)\
Aagh! Ooh! Ow!

Be right with you, madam.\
Ooh! Ow! Ooh!

Dad!\
Butt nits!

Ah-ah-ow!\
Nit bird!

Nit! Nit! Nit! Nit!\
Ow! Ooh! Ow!

Caw-ca-caw!

Nit! Nit-nit-nit-nit-nit!\
Ow! Ow!

Ki-ki-na-ki!

(GROANS)

It's no use, Bingo.\
Get the cricket bat.

OK.\
What?!

Where are you going?

BLUEY: She's getting the cricket bat!

Nit! Nit! Nit! Nit! Nit!\
Ow! Ooh! Aagh!

Bluey.\
Yes?

I'm so happy you're not\
talking OVER Bingo.

Yeah. I'm helping her find her voice.

I know. But if you talk FOR her,\
she won't find it either.

Oh.

So what should I do?

You have to find your ears!

They're on my head!

Bluey!\
OK.

I couldn't find the cricket bat.

(WEAKLY) It's OK. I think\
the nits have all gone.

Aww!

There definitely wasn't\
one or two left for Bingo?

I don't think so?

Are you sure you're not still\
a little bit itchy?

Oh, well...

Aagh! So itchy!

Aagh!\
He's still got nits!

ALL: Hooray!

What should we do, Bingo?

Um...um...um...

Bluey, you say it.

OK. Why don't we...?

Hang on.

No.

You keep going, Bingo.

Um... OK.

I want to, um...

..tie Dad upside down from the tree

and throw water balloons at him

and then cover him in nit powder -

which is flour -

and then rake him with the rake!

ALL: Yeah!

What?!

You found your voice!

And you found your ears!

ALL: Hooray!

(WEAKLY) Hooray?

Gee, Bingo,

when you find your voice,\
you sure find your voice.

Nit bomb - go!

Aagh! Yow!

Nit powder - release!

Yaagh! (COUGHS)

Get the stragglers!

Ow! (GIGGLES) Oh, that tickles.\
(BOTH GIGGLE)

Ooh! (GIGGLES) Ow! Ow!

(ALL LAUGH)

Wha...? Ow!

(BOTH LAUGH)

BOTH: Hooray!

Just...1,000 dollarbucks, please.

Doot.

See you again soon.

(WEAKLY) Hello.\
Ooh!

I don't have any nits.

Would you like to have\
a cup of tea with me?

Well, how could I resist that offer?

Shall we?

What should we play now?\
Ooh! I've got an idea.

Ooh, OK. I'm listening.

♪ Miss Mary Mack, Mack, Mack

♪ All dressed in black... ♪

Stumpfest!

Yeah, Stumpfest. Whoo!

What's going on?

Stumpfest!

This episode of Bluey\
is called Stumpfest.

What's Stumpfest?!

Well, we're gonna rip up this stump

and then...that stump!

Oooh!

Put on some tunes, you kids'll play.

And the ladies watch us\
get all sweaty. Right, ladies?

You got it, Lucky's Dad!

Yay!\
Whoo!

Yeah! Now, let's kick this off.

Aaaagh!

What do we play?

Ooh, I know. Let's set up\
a nail salon on this stump.

Yay!

Dad?

We're just gonna use this stump

for our nail salon.

That's fine, Bluey,

but you've got until we've finished\
with this stump, OK?

OK!

'Cause then, we're gonna\
come and do that one.

Yep.

So, you understand that eventually,

we're gonna come\
and rip up that stump?

Yes, I got it.

'Cause it's Stumpfest,\
and that's a stump.

Got it. Stumpfest.

OK, let's start the nail bar.

Hooray!

Whoar! Yah!

Oh, great finish.

Thanks, ladies.

I told you this place was great.

Come back soon.

We need more customers.

Dad? Can you be our customer?

Nah, stump.

Oh, you've almost got it.\
You've almost got it!

Whoo-hoo!\
Yeah!

How'd you like that?

Whoo!\
Yes!

Take that, stump!

We'll just do your toenails.

OK.

So, been up to much?\
No.

Oh, that's very interesting.

Hi.\
Ooh, hello!

Are you here\
to have your nails done?

Well, no.

We're not here to\
have our nails done.

We're here for that stump.

As I'm sure you are aware.

Excuse me?

It's the first I've heard\
about all this.

You guys need to move the beauty\
parlour so we can rip up that stump.

It's not a beauty parlour.\
It's a nail salon.

And it's our nail salon!

Yeah!

Bluey, I was pretty clear.

You could use this stump\
for your nail bar

for as long as it took us\
to rip up that stump.

I don't remember agreeing to that.

Well, I do. Now, come on. Vamoose!

No!\
Get out of the way!

Everyone, link arms!

Now...

Save our stump!

Save our stump!\
Out of the way, kids.

Save our stump!

Save our stump!\
Chilli!

Oh, leave them alone!

What?!

They're just trying\
to run a small business!

Go and destroy the planet\
somewhere else.

Destroy the planet? It's a stump.

Oh, leave that poor stump alone.

You're the one who wanted it gone.

Oh, yeah, that's true.\
I want to put in a fish pond.

Oh!

Boo!

Save our stump.

Save our stump! Save our stump!

OK, the optics on this aren't good.\
Save our stump!

We can take 'em.\
Nuh, nuh. Back up, fellas. Back up.

Kids, let's calm this down.

Is there anything we can do\
to settle this?

Hmm, one second.

What do you reckon?\
Be our customers.

OK. We'll let you have the stump

if you'll be our customers.

You mean, you'll do our nails?

Fingers and toes.

And face make-up.

Oh, man, the boys\
aren't gonna like this.

Oh, man.\
What?! No way!

I don't want my nails done.

This is the best we're gonna get.

OK, fingers and toes,\
but no face make-up.

One face make-up.

Ugh! OK, deal.

But no unicorns.

Oh, delightful!

Hold still, Daddy!

Ooh, this will do wonders\
for your skin.

Don't forget the eyeliner!

Ooh, yeah!\
Looking good, Bandit.

Just...don't, OK?

Finished!\
Alright, let's get this stump!

Yeah!

No, wait. Not yet!

Bluey!\
I've changed my mind.

I want to keep playing nail salon.

We had a deal.\
Come on, Bluey.

You did make a promise.

Ohh...

Why do they have to\
disturb our game?

Well, Dad did warn you.

But we were playing.

You shouldn't interrupt people\
when they're playing.

I agree.

Which is why I stopped\
you from disturbing them.

What?!\
But they're not playing.

Yeah, they are.\
They're not.

They're ripping up stumps.\
That's not playing.

Are you sure?\
I'm sure.

I'm suring my little head off.

Alright, just watch them for a bit.

Come on.

Hey, just try and hit me.

I wanna show you something.\
Alright.

Nup. Nah, not like that.

That's how I hit.\
Like this.

Ohh!

What are you doing?

Oh, sorry, my instincts took over.

Oh, they ARE playing.

See? It just looks a bit different\
for grown-ups.

They weren't disturbing our stump\
game. We were disturbing theirs.

Yahh!\
Get them!

Come on, Bluey.\
Let's save our nail salon.

Actually, um...

I have another game we can play.

Don't worry, Bandit.\
I know what you're going through.

Any time you wanna help.\
Oh, yep, yep, righto.

Yeah!

Yeah!

Stumpfest!

Whoo! You like that, Trixie?

Phew. Sure makes you thirsty!

Home delivery lemonade.

Oh, yeah!\
Good on ya, kids!

Here you go. 50 cents. Just pay her.

50 cents?\
Thanks, Bluey.

This is just what I need.

Oh, yes, you've all\
been working so hard.

To Stumpfest.\
Whoo-hoo!

Eeeh!

# "Favourite Thing" (Season 2 Episode 7)
Whoo! T-bone!

Hang on.\
Oh? Oh.

You ready?

BOTH ♪ For the golden corn\
and the apples on the trees

♪ For the golden butter\
and the honey from the bees

♪ For fruits and nuts and berries\
that grow beside the way

♪ We praise our loving Mother Earth\
to thank her every day

♪ Hooray! ♪

Well, that's new.

We learned it at kindie.

The honey bit's my favourite.

Oh! Can we play "What was\
your favourite thing today?"

OK.\
Hooray!

This episode of Bluey is called\
Favourite Thing.

You go first, Bluey.

Well, my Favourite Thing\
was at morning tea.

Bingo was trying to eat\
cherry tomatoes with her fork.

Agh! This is trifficult.

(ALL LAUGH)

She said "trifficult"!\
It was so funny.

Oh, Bingo.

You must have been trying\
to say tricky and difficult

at the same time. (CHUCKLES)

Oh, Bingo, honey. It's OK.

It's funny.

No, it isn't.

Bingo!

What did I say wrong?

Nothing, honey.\
Just eat your dinner.

I didn't mean to upset her.

I know. I think she's just\
embarrassed she said the word wrong.

It was funny.

Well, yeah, but I guess she thought\
you were laughing at her.

But I wasn't.\
I know.

Look, she'll be right.\
Just eat your dinner.

I'm sorry, Bingo.\
I didn't mean to embarrass you.

That's OK.

Are you still upset with me?\
No...

Oh, you are.

Come on, let's keep playing\
the Favourite Things game.

Whose turn is it?

Um...actually, I think I was wrong\
with what my Favourite Thing was.

Oh, OK. What's your new one?

Well, it wasn't\
at morning tea.

It was at afternoon tea.

BOTH: Oh, no.

Look, kids. All I ask is\
that you eat some alfalfa.

It will stop you getting sick.\
OK, dude.

And stop calling me dude.\
Sorry, dude.

Bluey, can it.\
Sure thing, dude.

(GIGGLES)\
Bluey, I'm serious.

What's up with these dudes?

(GIGGLES)

(LAUGHS)

That was a fun three hours.

Bingo, do you want to\
have your turn now?

Well, I'll have a turn.

Wait, Mum...\
Agh!

Can you make sure that\
your Favourite Thing

is something where Bingo does\
something really funny in it?

OK, sweetheart.

Ow!\
Proceed.

Well, my Favourite Thing\
happened today at lunchtime.

Mum?\
Yes.

Open the lid.\
OK.

Stick your finger in.\
Oh.

Now wiggle it around.

Uh... OK.

Take it out.

Now close the lid.

Thank you for cleaning my toilet.

What?!\
(ALL LAUGH)

Yuck!

That was disgusting!

Good one, Bingo.

Are you ready for your turn now?

Hmm!

Well, I'll tell you\
my Least Favourite Thing today.

Bingo, remember this one?

I was changing a lightbulb.

Daddy?\
Yeah, mate.

What's your name?\
Dad.

And what is this?\
Nose.

And what am I holding?\
Uh... Nothing.

(GIGGLES)

Dad. Nose. Nothing.

Oh, what?!\
(GIGGLES)

(ALL LAUGH)

Oh, your poor dad.\
That was funny.

Now that I think about it,\
my real Favourite Thing

actually was when\
Bingo and I were eating morning tea.

Bingo was trying to eat\
cherry tomatoes with her fork.

This is difficult.

Yow!

Jeremy, no!

Who will save Jeremy\
from the falling hippo?!

I will!

Yeah!\
Yeah!

Thanks, Jetpack Bingo.

Oh, hippo. (KISSES) I love you.

What?!\
(ALL LAUGH)

I don't remember that.

Hooray, you're happy again!

No, I'm not.

(GRUMBLES) This isn't fair, Bingo.

I said sorry.

And I tried 100 times\
to cheer you up.

But you're still\
trying to make me feel sad.

I can't help it.

She's not trying\
to make you feel sad, Bluey.

I'm just sad.

But, Bingo...

Just let her go.

But why is she still sad?

I thought I fixed her.

You can't always fix people,\
sweetheart.

She'll come good.\
Just eat your dinner.

I don't feel like eating now.

Mm! More for me.

Bandit! She's upset.

Yeah, but she's easy to cheer up.

No, I'm not.\
Yes, you are.

Dude!\
(GIGGLES)

Pass me the tomato sauce, dude.

Don't call me dude!

Why not, dude?

Pass salt, thanks, dude.

Don't you dude me.\
(GIGGLES)

Hey, dude!\
(GIGGLES)

Come have dinner, dude.

OK, dude.

Here's the sauce, dude.\
Thanks, dude.

OK, all good.

Is it my turn for "My favourite\
thing that happened today"?

Yep, I think it is.

Maybe let's not play that game.

Yeah, I agree.

Yeah! We're living in the past,\
dudes.

How about it still has to be\
a favourite thing,

but it has to be\
something happening right now.

Ooh! I like that.\
Yeah, live in the now, dudes.

Stop calling us dude.

OK, go, Bingo.\
Ooh! OK.

Uh...

Hmm.

(CLICKS TONGUE)

Um...\
Not much happening right now.

Yeah.

This is trifficult.

(ALL LAUGH)

That's my Favourite Thing!

# "Daddy Dropoff" (Season 2 Episode 8)
My name is Lila\
and this is my story.

This was me\
on my first day of kindy.

I was really shy.

Mum says that's OK,

but that meant sometimes I wasn't\
really good at making friends.

I just didn't know how to do it.

But then one day, that all changed.

And it started with pet feet.

Oh, hello, my lovely little\
pet foot.

Oh, hello,\
my lovely little pet foot.

Oh, you're extra stinky\
this morning.

Pooh, yeah.

Time for tricks. Ready?

Stand.

Good boy. Up.

Let's say hello to Lefty.

Your pet's attacking my pet!

Sit, Righty, sit.

Come here. Yaaa!

Oh, the kids - argh! - are awake.

You like making extra work\
for yourself, don't you?

Yeah. At least I get\
to lie in bed, though.

You know it's Daddy Dropoff\
this morning.

Right! Kids! Daddy Dropoff!

We are not gonna be late this time.

Huh? Hey.

Walkies!

This episode of Bluey\
is called Daddy Dropoff.

OK, gluten free, gluten not-free.

I'm off to work, kids.

Enjoy Daddy Dropoff.

I don't want a Daddy Dropoff,

I want a Mummy Dropoff.

Oh, don't worry.

Dad will make it extra fun,\
won't you, Dad?

Yep, yep, yep.

See ya, Mum.

Hey, food in gobs!\
The clock's ticking.

Oh, Bingo, do you hear something?

Mm, no.

Brekky! Come on!

Are you sure\
you don't hear something?

I'm sure.

It must be the wind.

It's me, your dad.\
Can't you hear me?

Oh, lovely morning,\
isn't it?

Indeed.

Kids!

I wish Father were here to enjoy it.

I'm right here!

In the car, kids.\
Come on. Go, go, go, go, go.

Argh! Forgot the keys.

Hey, Bluey, I found a wand.

Ooh, use it on Dad.\
OK.

Rack 'em and stack 'em, kids.

We gotta goooooo.

OK, that slo-mo set us back a bit,\
but we're still on time.

Wait, Bingo, did you\
remember your jumper?

I'm at my house.

It's a hundred miles away from you.

Oh, OK.

But did you bring your jumper?

You don't understand.

She's too far away to hear you.

You have to ring her on the phone.

Oh, alright.

Call Bingo.

Brrrt! Ring-ring, ring-ring.

Ring-ring, ring-ring.

Ring-ring, ring-ring.

Ring-ring, ring-ring.

Boop. Hello?

Oh, I'm actually after Bingo.

Well, you have the wrong number.\
This is Marjorie.

Oh, sorry, Marjorie. My mistake.

Don't let it happen again. Boop.

Call BINGO.

Brrrp. Ring-ring, ring-ring.

Boop. Hello?

Hello, Marjorie.

Is this you again?!

Yeah, look...\
Stop calling this number!

I'm trying to find out if Bingo\
left her jumper at home.

Well, I'm trying to have a shower!

It's just that we'll have to turn\
back if she's forgotten it.

♪ La-dee-dee! I'm in the shower!

♪ Oh, la-da-da... ♪

You don't live near Bingo, do you?

I've never heard of him.

Now, don't call me again. Boop!

Oh, these kids.

Call Bingo Heeler, a small red dog

who is definitely\
not called Marjorie!

Bee-boop-brrp. Ring-ring, ring-ring.

Come on, Bingo, please pick up.

Ring-ring, ring-ring!

Ooh, my phone's ringing.

Boop. Hello?

Oh, thank goodness.

Bingo, did you bring your jumper?

Mm, nope.

Argh, biscuits!

OK, kids, we've got to...\
Pew!

..goooooo.

OK, let's motor.

Dad, can we play Walk Straight?

OK.

Now, you need to walk straight,\
Bingo, OK?

Watch me.

See? Easy.

Now you do it.

Mmm! Bingo, walk straight.

Come on, it's not hard.

Oh, man, we are late!

See ya, Bingo.

Bit of sunscreen.

Alright, keep it real, Bingo.

Dad?

Yes, mate?

You didn't do Wind-Up Bingo.

Oh, look, mate, I gotta\
get Bluey to school.

But you always do Wind-Up Bingo.

Oh, I know, it's just\
we're running late, kiddo.

But how will I get in the door?

OK.\
Hooray!

Let's aim you up.

Wind. Wind. Wind. Wind.

And one for good luck. Wind!

And...release.

Dut-dut-dut-dut-dut-dut.

See ya, Wind-Up Bingo!\
See ya!

Oh, we're...so...late!

Dad?\
Yeah, mate?

If we didn't play Wind-Up Bingo just\
then, would we still be late?

Well, probably not as late.

So, why did you play it, then?

Mm, I don't know. Just did.

But what if you didn't?

What would happen then?

Probably nothing, I suppose.

Bingo would just walk\
through the door instead.

Yeah, she would.

Wouldn't be as fun, though.

Yeah.

I'm glad you did play it.

Yeah, me too.

Me three. Because that was\
the first time I met Bingo.

See ya!

Dut-dut-dut-dut-dut-dut-dut-\
doot-doo...doo...dooo...

Hey, can you wind me back up,\
please?

Wind, wind, wind, wind, wind.

Dut-dut-dut-dut-dut-dut.

Dut-dut-dut-dut-dut-dut.\
Dut-dut-dut-dut-dut-dut.

Bingo is my friend now.

And I hope we're friends\
forever and ever and ever.

Dut-dut-dut-dut-dut-dut.

Dut-dut-dut-dut-dut-dut.

Dut-dut-dut-dut-dut-dut.

Dut-dut-dut-dut-dut-dut.

Doo-doo-doo.

# "Bingo" (Season 2 Episode 9)
Ah, what a nice sunny day.

Ah, nice and sunny.\
Yeah, nice and sunny.

Uh-oh, problem. It's raining!

Arggh!\
Arggh!

Quick, get under the mumbrella.

Arggh.\
Phew, nice and dry.

Oh, no, the mumbrella's blowing away!

Phew.

Nice and dry...

Alright. Bluey, let's go.

See ya, Mum. See ya, Bingo.

See ya. Have fun.

Can you play with me until Bluey\
gets back from Chloe's house?

I can't, honey.\
There's a problem with the toilet.

It won't flush. Mum has to fix it.

But who am I going to play with?

You're gonna play with Bingo.

Oh, yeah!

This episode of Bingo\
is called Bingo.

OK, Mum's gotta get to it.

You go play by yourself.\
OK.

Oh, one problem.

Oh, yeah, what's that?

I don't know how to play by myself.

Yeah, you do, sweetie.\
You're just not used to it.

Give it a go.\
OK, Mama.

♪ Doo, doo, dee-doo, dee-doo... ♪

What am I gonna do?

Oh, I'll play doctor.

Next patient.

Oh, yeah, this won't work.

♪ Dee-doo, doo, doo... ♪

Hmm... Ooh, I know.

I spy with my little eye,\
something coloured green.

Oh, wait, this won't work either.

It was rug, by the way.

♪ Dee-doo, doo, dee-doo... ♪

Hmm, maybe I can play\
a railings game.

What if I lift you up a bit?

Mum, problem!

It happened again.

Oh, Bingo, I told you.\
Don't put your legs in the railing.

Sorry, Mama.\
Turn it.

Yep, there you go.

I'm having a problem getting started.

Maybe you're just hungry.\
Oh, yeah!

Ooh, raspberries and blueberries.

Which one do I want?

Raspberries or blueberries?

Hmm...

Hey. Do you mind, fridge?

I'm trying to decide.

Now, raspberries or...

Hey! So rude!

Maybe if I open then shut you.

Shut.

Open.

OK, now...

Oh, that's it, fridge. I'm leaving!

Oh, but I'm really hungry.

OK, I'm just gonna close\
my eyes and choose.

Eee, mmm...

Blueberries!

OK, OK!

I'm going to eat you.

Umf, umf, umf.

Alright, I'm not hungry anymore.

Now, what's a game\
that only needs Bingo?

Ooh, I know.

Why won't you flush?!

Bingo?\
Yes?

Are you OK?\
Yeah.

What are you doing?

I'm hiding!

Oh, OK.

Why are you hiding?

I'm playing hide and seek.

Right.

Who's coming to find you?

Oh!

I just miss my sister.

I know.

And the fridge doesn't like me.

I...know?

Are you sure you can't play with me\
just a little bit?

No, honey, I have to fix the toilet.

But that's not fun.

It's fun for me.\
I like a good problem.

Maybe I need a good problem.

Ahh, that's it, Bingo!

You don't need a game.\
You need a problem.

Ooh!

I'm back.

Dad, do you have\
a good problem for Bingo?

Well, yeah, I do, actually.\
Ooh, what is it?

Well, on the way to Chloe's,

Bluey wanted to know\
what colour kiwis were.

The fruit? They're green.

No, the little furry animal\
that lives in New Zealand.

Hmm, that is a tricky one.

Yeah, I had no idea.\
Do you know, Bingo?

No, but I know how to find out.

Thanks.\
No problem.

Can you fix that tile for me?

World map puzzle!

OK, all the blue bits here\
and red bits here.

Nice and straight, Bandit.\
Nice and straight.

This bit goes here,\
which means that bit can do that.

Finished! Wait, not finished.

I'm missing a piece.\
Oh, yeah.

You're missing New Zealand.\
Oh, not again.

No problem, I can find it.

Where are you, New Zealand?

New Zealand?

I know - I'll draw missing posters\
for New Zealand.

Finished!

Hello, fridge. I want to stick\
a New Zealand poster on you.

Beep twice if we can be friends.

Thanks, fridge.

Oh, little anty.

You're trying to carry that food\
all by yourself.

Well, keep going, little fella.

OK, the posters are all up.

New Zealand will show up very soon.

Sweet as, Bingo.\
I'm almost finished.

You want me to play with you?\
No, thanks. I'm OK.

See ya, Chloe! Huh?

I'm back.\
Hey!

Bingo, you're missing\
a puzzle piece!

Yeah, New Zealand. Have you seen it?

It's on your bum.\
Oh!

Oh, Bingo.

The posters worked.

Look, Bluey.

Dad, kiwis are brown!

Hooray!

It works!\
Hooray!

Thanks, Mum.\
Thanks, Bingo.

No problem.

# "Rug Island" (Season 2 Episode 10)
Dad, can you play with us?

Sorry, kiddo,\
I've gotta get to work.

Oh, I wish you didn't have to work.

That's what grown-ups do,\
I'm afraid.

Well, I'm glad I'm a kid.

Enjoy it while it lasts.

Please, can you play with us?

I can't, mate. I'll see you later.

Oh.

Hey, kids, I bought\
some new felt pens.

Rug Island!

Huh?

This episode of Bluey\
is called Rug Island.

I caught some fish!

Ooh, nice shelter, Bingo.\
Thanks.

I'm going to get some pippies.

Pippies doing wee-wees.

Bluey.

Oh, man.

I must have fallen off my ship.

What is it, Bingo?\
It's a grown-up.

Let's eat him.\
Ow!

Get off!\
Yah!

Don't worry, we're friendly.\
I'm not.

Ow!

Bluey, stop biting him.

Grown-ups don't belong on Rug Island.

Oh, please, I just wanna\
get back to my ship.

Well, you can stay with us\
until your ship comes back.

Or until I get really hungry.\
Eeh!

I gotta say,\
this place looks pretty chill.

What's for breakfast?

Listen, grown-up...\
Ooh.

..if you wanna stay on Rug Island,\
you have to work.

Up-zup-zup.\
Oh, man, ripped off.

This is how we pick our own food.

Fruit.

Ah, too easy.

Fruit.\
That's a snake.

Argh! Get off me.

Spear.

Fish.

Spear.

Oh.\
That's OK.

Fish.

Ah, I see.

Carrot.\
Yeah! You got it.

Watch what he can do.

Whoosh.\
Fire!

Ah, grown-up?\
Huh?

Yeow, my bum!

Ah.

Fish!\
Yeah.

Fish.

Cook, cook, cook.

Plate?\
Thanks. Have some beetroot.

Oh, thanks.

Banana?\
Ta.

Don't forget the salads.

Oh, wonderful salads.\
Delicious, Bingo.

Thank you.\
Oh, the greenery.

I love Rug Island.

Yeah, it's great, isn't it?

Maybe you could stay here forever.

Really? You'd be OK with that?

Yeah.

Well, it is tempting.

Life's so simple here.

It's like the outside world\
doesn't exist.

Catch!\
Oh, what was that?!

Look!

A white chocolate egg!

Wow!

I'll get it, Lucky.

A grown-up. We have to hide!

Where'd it go?

He's walking on water.

It must be some sort\
of grown-up magic.

What does he want?

Well, he wants the ball,\
I mean, the egg.

It's his.\
No way. We're keeping it.

Well, yeah, but we have to give him\
his ball back, Bingo.

But it's not a ball, it's an egg.

Well, yeah, but just in the game.

Oh! No.

I told you, Bingo,\
grown-ups don't belong on Rug Island.

Hi, Bandit.\
What's with all the pens?

Oh, um, it's hard to explain.

Ah, just need the ball?

Oh, yeah, well...

The thing is...

Bandit?\
Ah, yep, yep, here you go.

Snake!\
Argh! Get it off me!

Get the grown-up.\
Banana attack!

I was just trying to get\
my ball back.

It's not a ball!

Yeah! It's an egg!

Yowl!

For good bravery\
and rescuing the chocolate egg,

you are now not a grown-up.

Congratulations.

Hooray!

Now, let us lick the egg.

Ahoy there.

Ah, it's my ship.

They've come to take me home.

But this is your home.

You can't have two homes.

Yeah, you're right.

What am I gonna do?

You should go.

Really? Are you sure?

Yes, it's OK.

I'm just glad you came\
to Rug Island.

Oh, come here.

I'm gonna miss you.

Maybe you can come with me.

No. This is my home.

♪ Doo, doo, doo, doo

♪ Doo, doo, doo-doo

Wait. Here.

It's a present for you.\
Oh, thanks.

♪ Doo, doo, doo

♪ Doo, doo, doo, doo\

# "Charades" (Season 2 Episode 11)
OK, Mum. At least try and limit\
the amount of ice blocks

to a reasonable number.

OK. Got it.

Right, let's go!\
See you, kids.

Be good to Nana.

KIDS: Bye!

Ice blocks!

Yeah!

Nana...\
Yes, sweetie?

Why do we get lots of ice blocks\
at your house,

but hardly any\
when we're at our house?

Oh, well, that's a good question.

Finished! Can we play charades now?

KIDS: Yeah!\
Woof!

This episode of Bluey\
is called Charades.

What's charades?

It's easy, Muffin.\
First you pick a card...

But don't let anyone see it, OK?

OK!\
(BARKS)

Then you look at the picture on it.

OK, got it.\
What's on the card?

No, Muffin!\
Ooh!

But I need to see it!

Oh, no, sweetie,\
WE don't look at it.

Bluey's going to act it out.\
And then we guess what it is.

Oh!

OK. Ready?

ALL: Ready!

Uh...\
Eagle!

No.

Oh...it's a bush turkey.

Ibis!\
Squirrel!

Nope!\
Brolga!

Chicken!\
What about you, Socks?

Hmm...

Duck!\
Yeah!

ALL: Hooray!\
Good one, Bingo!

Ooh, it's my turn!

I want a turn!

Maybe just watch one more, sweetie.

OK, Nana.

Go on, Bingo. Pick a card.

(GIGGLES)

Ooh! This is a good one.

You ready?

ALL: Yes!\
Ready.

Oh...circle!\
Doughnut!

No.

The sun!\
Squirrel!

Uh-uh.

Chicken!\
No.

A dancer.\
Close!

What do you think, Socks?

Hmm.

Chicken!\
I know! Ballerina!

Yeah!

Hooray!\
Good one, Bluey.

Mmm.\
Oh, never mind, Socks.

It's my turn!

OK, Muffin. Your turn.

Are you sure you know how to do it?

Yes, I know.

Pick a card.

OK, now take a look.

Now act it out.

I don't want a frog card.

I want the ballerina card.

Oh. Uh, well...

Muffin! You have to do\
the one on the card!

But I want to do the ballerina!

Oh, OK.

Bluey, why don't you look through\
the box for the ballerina card?

OK.\
(HUMS)

Thanks, Bluey.

Hang on, won't we know\
that Muffin is a ballerina?

Oh, yeah, but we'll play along\
for the littlies, OK?

Oh, OK, Nana.

Almost there, Muffin.

OK, Nana.

I can't find it.

Keep looking.

What about a car?

Ooh! Would you like to be a car,\
Muffin?

You can do this.

That's a squirrel!

Give me those cards, Bluey.

That's not a car!\
Yeah, it is.

A car's like this.

That's a steering wheel.

It must be in here somewhere.

I don't want to be a car!

I want to be a...

Ballerina!\
KIDS: Hooray!

There you go, Muffin.

Thanks, Nana.

OK, off you go.

I need a tutu!

Oh, uh...\
(GROANS)

Muffin!\
Um...

Bluey, go and check Nana's\
dress-up box for a tutu.

OK.\
Quickly!

She's gonna blow her top.

Ooh, confetti!

Pirate, princess...\
Tutu!

Here's the tutu, Muffin!

Thanks, Bluey.

Oh, good one, girls.

Put your leg through, Muffin!

I'm trying!

That's your arm!

(GRUNTS)\
Push! Yeah, that's it.

(GROANS)\
(GRUNTS)

Push! Push, Muffin!\
Got it!

ALL: Yay!

OK, off you go.

I need ballerina music!

(ALL GROAN)\
BLUEY AND BINGO: Muffin!

How about I sing you some?\
♪ La-di-doo... ♪

(SCREAMS) No!

It needs to be\
proper ballerina music!

You don't need music, Muffin.\
You just need...

I want music!

OK. (GIGGLES NERVOUSLY)

Oh, uh, um...

Ooh, I know!

Bluey, Bingo, come with me.

Did you know that I was given\
this music box by my nana?

You mean you had a nana?

I did a long time ago.

Hang on, we all know that\
Muffin is going to be a ballerina.

Well, yes, I guess we do.

But that's not the proper rules.

You're right, Bingo.

But that's what Muffin wants.

I don't understand.

Well, you know what,

at Nana's house,\
I guess there's only one rule.

BOTH: What's that?

Everyone gets what they want.

BOTH: Oh, yeah! (GIGGLE)

We got the music!

OK, you ready, Muffin?

Ready!\
You ready, Socks?

(BARKS)

Ready, girls?

BOTH: Ready, Nana!

OK, let's go!

Nana...\
Yes, Bluey?

Was your nana a nice nana?

She was about the nicest nana\
you would ever want to meet, Bluey.

(TINKLING MUSIC BOX MUSIC)

Hey, Nana...

..when she's finished,\
shall we pretend

that we didn't know what she was?

Good idea, Bingo.

'Cause we have to\
take care of the littlies.

That's right.

Shush!

Oop!

BLUEY AND BINGO: Hooray!\
Hooray!

Good one, Muffin!

Can you guess what I was?

ALL: Um...

Any idea girls?

Maybe...\
What was Muffin?

Ballerina!

Yes!\
ALL: Yay!

(BARKS)\
Well done, Socks!

# "Sticky Gecko" (Season 2 Episode 12)
Come on, kids, we have to go!

Quick sticks.\
Oh, why?

We're meeting Judo at the park.

If we don't get a move on,\
we'll be late.

Oh, can we not go just yet?

Why not?\
Just because.

That's not a reason.\
Now, where's your hat?

I don't know.\
Well, find it.

We're leaving in one minute.

Is one minute this long?

More like this long.

Have you cleaned your teeth?\
Yeah.

Show me.\
Ahhhh.

When did you clean them?\
Last night.

OK. Go and clean your teeth.\
Oh.

Come on! I'll time you.\
Ready, set, go!

Argh!\
Bingo, package.

Ah.

Whoa! Hey, Bluey, hat. Bingo, teeth.

I just need to deliver this.\
Deliver what?

Sticky Gecko!

Oh, no.

Hooray!

This episode of Bluey\
is called Sticky Gecko.

Come to Mama, little Gecky.

I'm still timing you, Bingo.

But I have to catch Gecky.

You brush your teeth,\
I'll catch Gecky.

OK.\
No.

You find your hat, I'll catch Gecky.

Keep timing!

I can't find it.

Have you looked.\
Yeah, I've looked everywhere.

There it is.

Oh, yeah.

Come on, Gecky.

What was it that Grandad used to say\
when he was a soldier?

Hurry up and wait.\
Hurry up and wait.

Bingo, teeth!

Oh, yeah.

Ooh!

Sorry!\
Are you OK?

Yeah, I'm OK.\
Good, then help me tidy this up.

Oh, why do I have to help?

Ooh, OK.\
Who's catching Gecky?

Argh! I am.

My banana!

I'll get it!

Here it comes.

Yuck. Toothpastey.

OK, let's go, I need you\
out the door in one minute.

Can I have my hat like Grandad's,

with the side bit up like that?

Oh, look, Bluey...\
Please?

OK. Go and get a badge but hurry up!

Sorry!

Time for rollerskates.

Mum! Gecky.\
Sorry. Come on, Gecky.

Eeeeh.

Chk-chk, stop!\
Ooh, one minute, well done.

Now let's get going.

I'm just gonna\
put on my rollerskates.

Bingo, there's no time!\
Oh!

Alright. Let me put them on for you.

No, you have to time me.

OK. Ready, set, go.

And we can't leave\
before Gecky falls off.

Oh, look...

..I'm gonna give him a hand,\
alright?

I found a badge!

Great. Bluey, can you please grab\
my hockey stick?

I need to get Gecky down.\
OK.

The rabbit goes round the garden...

No, no, try again.

Look who I found!

Chattermax!

Bluey, hockey stick!\
I couldn't find it.

Did you look?\
Never mind, give me that.

I'll use Chattermax.

Dammit. Really stuck!

Gecky doesn't like being rushed.

Argh!

Finished!\
They're on the wrong feet, darl.

Are they? I'll start again.

Oh, Bingo, there's just no...

Ow!

Mum, have you seen my hat?

Ooooooo...

Argh! Right, that's it.

We're not going to the park!\
We're just staying here, then.

So...we're not going anywhere?

No. We'll just stay here forever.

Oh.

That's it! Come on, out, out, out!\
I don't understand!

We're leaving now.

OK, OK.

I just have to find my hat.

The door. It is right here.

All we need to do is walk out of it.

It's so easy!

Why do we have to go right now?

Because I don't want to be late!\
But why?

Because it's not nice\
to keep people waiting.

Especially Judo's mum.

She can get a little funny\
if you're not on time.

Oh, why?

Well, I guess she thinks it's rude.

But it just takes ages\
getting out of the house.

Why?

Because you kids don't care\
about being on time.

Why?\
Because you're too busy having fun.

In fact, that's why\
we're going to the park.

Judo's been asking\
for a play date for ages.

Why?\
Because you're a lovely little kid.

Why?

Because I put a lot of work\
into making sure

you're a lovely little kid.\
Why?

Because lovely little kids\
turn into lovely grown-ups.

Like Judo's mum.

She really is lovely, actually.

Why?

Well, when you were born,\
she made us five lasagnes.

Mmm!

It meant so much to me.

That's the sort of person\
I want you to be.

Why?

Because I want you to have\
a happy life.

Why?\
Because I love you!

But why?

Just...because!

That's not a reason!

Oh, OK! You win!

Ooh.

So, what's going on, Bluey?

Why can't you get out the door?

I'm just nervous about seeing Judo.

I hear you.

It's been a long time\
since you've seen her.

Just be brave, OK?

Like your grandad.

Attention! Forward march.

Hup, hup, hup.

Stop.\
Huh?

Oh, chk-chk-chk, click. Ah!

Was that one minute?\
Pretty much.

Ooh.

You have no idea what a minute is,\
do you, sweetheart?

Nope.\
That must be nice.

It's Judo's mum.

She's running late!

Oh, well, take your time, kids.

I'm hungry.

Ooh, banana.

Whoop! Oh.

Gotcha.

# "Dad Baby" (Season 2 Episode 13)
You missed a spot, Bluey.

Oh, do I have to get every bit?

If you're gonna do\
something, do it properly.

OK.

Mum, what's this?

Oh, that's your old papoose.

Papoose?

We used to walk you around the park\
in it instead of sleeping.

Straps go around here,\
and baby goes in here.

Get in it, Bingo.

OK.\
Hey! Oh, hang on.

You're not a baby. Ooh! Oww.

Look, Dad has a baby\
in his belly.

I know what we can play.

Oh, no, don't say it.

This episode of Bluey\
is called Dad Baby.

This isn't gonna end well.

OK, you're pregnant with baby Bingo.

So you have to act pregnant.

OK. If we're gonna do this,\
let's do it properly.

Hmm, how to act pregnant.

I'm just gonna get this ready.

Oh, my back. Oh, my feet.

Rub my feet, Bluey. Rub my feet.

Bandit Heeler!

I'm hungry. Oh, I need to sit down.

Oh, where's my Vitamin E cream?

Something about stretch marks.

Ow! Ow!\
How dare you!

You have no idea\
what I went through.

How could you? Ow!

I'm with child.

Oh, slow down, Bluey.

It's hard to run.\
Is she still following us?

Ow!\
Whoops.

Ah, I better clean that up.

Oh, cheese and crackers.\
You're heavy, Bingo.

Bluey, can you clean\
this up for me, mate?

OK.\
I'm going to sit down.

Ooh!\
Whoop.

Watch it, big belly.

Sorry.\
Argh!

Whoop!

Oh, man, I'm hungry.

OK, remember you're\
eating for two people now.

Sounds good to me.

Ow! Watch it.

So we've got cucumbers and radishes.

Ah, I've actually got\
cravings for these dim sims.

Dim sims?

The baby wants dim sims.

Hmm, OK.

Mine!\
Hey!

I'll try again.

Mine.

Right.

Mine!

Mine!\
Hey, Bingo, I'm hungry!

Come on! Pregnant people\
need exercise too.

Oh, man, this thing\
is uncomfortable.

Oh, my back.

Forget this. I need to sit down.

How's it going, pregnant man?

Oh, yeah. It's too easy, man.

Don't know what\
all the fuss is about.

Oh, good. Well, soon you'll start\
feeling the baby kicking.

Oh, no! I'm sure that's not\
for a little while... Ow!

Kick.\
Ow!

Kick.\
Ow!

Kick.\
Oh, me guts.

Oh, you never forget\
that first kick.

Oh! OK, that's a wrap kids.

Come on, unclip...\
No, not yet!

You haven't had the baby.

Kick!\
Oh, ho! Too bad.

How do you get this thing off?

You said if you're going to do\
something, do it properly.

Kick!\
Oh!

That advice doesn't apply to me.

Hello!

He's having a baby!

What happens now?

how to deliver a baby.

We grew sorghum.

Just shout if there's a wicket.

Mum!

Dad!

Bingo!

Bluey!

(BLOWS)

That's going to have\
to do for this one.

Thanks, Mum.

(GIGGLES)\
Hey, come here!

Oh, Bingo.\
Good girl for having your bath.

Yeah, but she hasn't\
cleaned her teeth.

(SHRIEKS AND GIGGLES)\
Come here!

It's your bath time too, Bluey.\
I can smell you from here.

Oh, but I want to play\
Mum School with you.

What's Mum School?

It's a school\
where you learn to be a mum.

This is Kiwi, Windgust,\
Lightning Bolt, Dronigan,

and that's Pearl.

They're my children.

I gave birth to them all.

Oh, my goodness.

What about that one?

Oh, Greeny! You're such a pickle.

OK. I'm running the bath.

No, not yet.

You're the lady who gives me a score\
for being a good mum.

Oh, you don't need someone\
keeping score of your mothering.

Oh, not again! I'll get you down.

Ooh, sorry kids.

On second thoughts...

This episode of Bluey\
is called Mum School.

OK. Children, movie time now.

Everyone sit up straight\
and not on top of each other.

Lightning Bolt,\
please get off Windgust.

OK. good.

Argh!\
Ooh!

Ah, Greeny,\
maybe you should hold Mummy's hand.

Oh, very good. Two points.

OK. Movie time.

Which button is it?

Oh! Greeny, I'm trying\
to concentrate, honey.

Hmm. Oh, hop over there.

Argh!\
Waah, Mummy, Greeny pushed me!

Greeny, what has gotten into you?

Now keep your hands\
to yourself please, young man.

Nyah-nyah, Greeny's a cushion head!

Windgust, we do not call people\
"cushion head" in this house.

Mmm, good mothering.

Waa, Mama, Greeny hit me!

Well, you kind of had that coming.

I'm not sure about that.

Ha-ya!

(GIGGLES)

Greeny, honey, come down from there!

I think these kids\
need some exercise.

How about everyone goes\
for a nice swim in the indoor pool?

Yeah! Come on, you lot.

Come back here\
and clean your teeth, young lady!

Come on, come on!

This way to the pool!

Oh, what strength!

Oh, it's so difficult\
when they just ignore me.

Yes, it is.

Why can't you kids\
just walk in a straight line?

They don't know how.\
You have to show them.

I'm just going to show you something,\
kids.

Oh!

I don't think that's a good idea.

Well, I don't have any other ideas.

(GIGGLES)

Come on, Greeny. You're old enough\
to walk by yourself.

Greeny finds walking\
a little tricky.

Oh, nonsense. He's got two legs.

This way!

Boop! No, no, stay down.

Boop!

I don't understand\
why you keep running off!

I don't think he can help it.

OK. That's everyone in the pool!

Enjoy your swim, sweeties!

Now Greeny,\
if I let you out of there,

are you going to behave yourself,

or are you just going to\
float up to the roof?

I think you know the answer.

No problem,\
I'll just get old bunty out.

No more bunty in Mum School.

Well, then what am I meant to do?

Gotcha!\
Yelp!

Ooh! One moment.

I just have to mark\
this other student.

He's in Dad School.

Oh, man, this sack of\
potatoes sure is heavy.

Put me down!\
You got it.

Hey!\
Eee!

Gee, she's quick.

Ooh, making it fun. Two points!

Now, clean.

Yeah!\
Hey!

Oh, he's let himself down there.

No!\
Bingo! Let go!

Unhand me!

Time to bring out the big guns.\
Tickle, tickle, tickle, tickle!

Ooh, good move.

Rahh! Gotcha!

I don't want to clean my teeth!\
Ah, Bingo!

There must be a reason why\
you're being such a pickle tonight.

Hmm. I think you're still hungry.

Come on, you need more food.

I'll race you to the kitchen.

Go!\
Arrgh!

Wackadoo! Top marks!

Wooo!

Now, do you wanna have\
another go with Greeny?

Hi, sweetheart,

I think there's a reason\
you keep floating off, isn't there?

Hmm, what could it be?

Maybe you just like exploring.

Oh, that's nice, Greeny.

Well, you're not old enough\
to go exploring too far yet,

so this is a special present\
for you, because I love you so much.

One day you can float up\
as high as you want.

But for now, this will help\
you stay down here with us.

Now, everyone in the pool.

Nice work, Mum.

That's it, children.\
Pearl, get off, Jonigan.

There you go, darling. All dry.\
Excellent drying.

You've almost passed Mum School.

Ooh, did you hear that, kids?

Excuse me, can I have\
a go at the hair dryer?

OK. Just be careful.

Arghh!

Oh, sorry children.

Oh, Greeny!

Greeny, no!

Can you get him back?

No, honey. He's off.

Will he be OK?

Yeah, I think he'll do just fine.

How do you know?

Because he's got a good mum.

Does this mean I failed Mum School?

Well...yeah.

Oh, I'm such a cushion head.

It's OK.\
We all fail Mum School sometimes.

Oh, OK.

We can just start again tomorrow.

Thanks, Mum.

Pshh-kkk.\
Thank you.

Morning, Sharice.

Morning, Doctor Glenda.

We have a very busy day today.

One sick tiger, and six sick skunks.

That's hard to say. Grr!

Oh, and one cranky polar bear.

Oh, you just need to tickle him.\
Here, watch.

Tickle, tickle. See?

What would we do\
without you, Glenda?

Train skipping this station.

Hey, wait. I'm coming.

Ugh. Train stopping.

(HUMS TO SELF) Off you go.

Um, excuse me.

No food or drinks, no feet on seats,

and that cat needs to be\
on your lap.

Ah, just drive the train, mate.\
What?!

You cheeky little...\
Hang on, show me your ticket.

Oh, yes, here you are.

Hmm, this looks fine.

Maybe you should lick it as well.

Oh, OK. A bit strange, but...

Bluh, bluh, bluh.

And now rub it all over your face.

This is a bit unorthodox, but OK.

(HUMS TO SELF)\
(LAUGHS)

What's so funny?\
That isn't a train ticket.

Huh?\
It's a piece of poo!

What?!

Bleagh. I licked poo!\
(LAUGHS)

Arggh. (SPITS)

Right, that's it. Get off my train!

Oh, where is that train?

MUM: Bing, bong.

The next train will be a bit late

due to an ongoing\
passenger incident.

Oh.

Train stopping. Apologies, customer.

Boop. That's OK.

But be quick.\
I'm late for drop-off.

And they lived happily ever after.

Train stopping. Uhh!

(PANTS) I'm sorry I'm late.

Oh, Poppy, you just missed\
story time.

Wahh!

I'll pick you up after work.\
Mum loves you.

I hope that train's on time.

Train stopping. Oh, you again.

I hope you've got\
a real ticket this time.

Oh, yes, sorry about the mix-up.

Boop. See?\
Ah, good.

(HUMS TO SELF)\
Ahh!

I'm putting this cat on your lap.

Uh, I wouldn't touch him\
if I were you.

Oh, don't be... Arggh!

Get it off!\
(LAUGHS)

Ring, ring.\
Hello?

Glenda, where are you? This polar\
bear is getting REALLY cranky.

Grrr!\
The train's running late.

You're gonna have\
to tickle him yourself.

Um, OK, I'll give it a go.

I'll be there soon. Good luck.

Oh, I'm so sorry we're late.

Hurry. The polar bear\
is getting cranky.

Train leaving!

Ohh.

Train stopping.\
Thank you.

What happened?\
The polar bear escaped!

He didn't like how I tickled him.

He's on the loose and he's cranky!\
Oh, no.

(HAGGARDLY) Train arriving.

Oh, look, the train is here.

Oh, I'm so sorry we're late.

Hang on, have I seen you before?

Oh, no, we just moved\
here from, uh, Egypt.

Oh, good, 'cause I do not\
like being attacked by animals.

Rarr!\
Arggh! Ho-ho!

(LAUGHS)\
Bite, bite.

Oh. Mr Cottonsocks, you're hurt!

It IS you. I knew it!

My cat is hurt. He needs a vet.

Quick, hop on the train.

All aboard! Express train!

Faster!

(ELDERLY VOICE) Oh, I hope the train\
will be here soon, Rita.

(ELDERLY VOICE) Me, too, Madge.\
We'll be late for mahjong.

Stand back from the platform!

Oh, here it...

Sorry, ladies!\
Ohh!

Hang in there, Mr Cottonsocks.

Train arriving.

Oh!

Mr Cottonsocks needs to see the vet!

I'm sorry, we had to shut down.

Our vet was late and a polar bear\
ate all the animals.

Oh!

I know, let's catch the train\
to the vet's house.

Yeah!

Go!\
Oh, man.

Oh, Poppy, I really miss\
taking care of animals.

Ohh! Train stopping.

Doctor Glenda, it's an emergency!

Please help Mr Cottonsocks.

Oh, deary me.\
Bring him here at once.

Fix, fix, fix.\
There, she's all better.

ALL: Hooray!

Thanks, Doctor Glenda.\
That's OK.

Glenda, why don't\
you start a home vet?

Yeah!

Where the train delivers\
customers to your house.

Yeah!

And I'll make sure the animals\
follow all the train rules.

No way. I am done with animals.

Rarr!\

# "Army" (Season 2 Episode 16)
Mum!

Dad!

Bingo!

Bluey!

Mum!\
Hey, Jack! Oh!

How was your first day\
at your new school?

Good.\
Tell me all about it.

Well, we drove there in the car and\
I couldn't sit still, as usual.

Come on, Jack.\
Can you sit still, mate?

Yes, Dad.

Did you remember your hat?\
Um, my hat. Where's my hat?

Ooh, look, a goat!\
(GOAT BLEATS)

Jack, your hat?\
I forgot it.

Oh, Jack, what are we going\
to do with you, mate?

Dad, Jack's still not sitting still!

Jaaaack.\
Sorry, I forgot.

Why can't you do as you're told?

I don't know.

Then we got to school\
and I met my teacher, Calypso.

Well, hello.

You must be my new student.

I'm Jack.

Jack can't sit still\
or remember anything.

Grr!

Well, I think you should go and play\
with that red kelpie down there.

OK. Bye, Dad!

You have fun, mate!\
I will!

And that's when I met Rusty.

What are you playing?

I'm playing army.

I'm about to go on patrol.

Can I be in the army?\
Well, maybe.

Can you do as you're told?

No. I'm not good\
at doing what I'm...

Attention!\
Ah!

On the left! Quick march!

Hup-hup-hup halt!

On the right!

March! Hup-hup-hup halt!

Salute!

Yeah, you can play.

This episode of Bluey\
is called Army.

You can't just start as a soldier.

You have to go to basic training

where you learn all the stuff\
from your drill sergeant.

That's me.\
Oh. OK.

Where's your hat, Recruit Russell?\
I forgot it, Sergeant.

You can use my spare.

But from now on,\
keep track of your equipment.

Yes, Sergeant.

Hup!\
Hup!

(BOTH LAUGH)

Rusty took me into the bush\
to learn all the army stuff.

The first thing I had to learn\
was heaps of hand signals.

Stop!

This one means "stop".

This means "get down!"

This is "move over there".

Ha!

I'll get it! Huh?

Now Rusty and I can\
talk to each other without talking.

An important part\
of the army stuff is doing push-ups.

Good push-ups, Recruit Russell.

Also, everything had a name.

OK. That hill is called Hill Four.

That one is called Hill Six.

That blue gum is called Tango Seven.

You got that?

Oh Sarge, I'm not good\
at remembering numbers or words.

Well, you better get good

if you want to be in the army,\
Recruit Russell.

You need to know these things\
if we call for a dust-off.

A dust-off?

A dust-off is when you call in\
a helicopter to come and rescue you.

You have to tell\
the chopper where to land.

Rusty loved calling for a dust-off.

(GRUNTS)

But the funnest bit\
was the sentry duty.

It's when you're a guard.

You have to be on the lookout\
when the other soldiers sleep.

I loved it.

All the other soldiers\
are counting on you.

I was really good at sentry.

You're really good at sentry.\
Thanks, Sarge.

Have some rations, Recruit Russell.

"Rations" is what they call food\
in the army.

How do you know\
so much about the army?

'Cause my dad's in the army.

Is he on patrol like us?

Yeah, but not for long.

Oh, that's good.

He said when he comes back,

he's going to bring me\
some condensed milk.

Ahh, I love condensed milk!

Then the scariest bit happened.

(RUSTLING)\
(GASPS)

(RUSTLING)

Contact!\
What do we do?

Fall back!

Arrgh!\
(TURKEY GOBBLES)

Get down!\
(GRUNTS)

There's too many of them!

We have to call for a dust-off!

I told you he loved dust-offs.

Six-one, this is six-two!\
We are surrounded!

Request immediate dust-off.\
Stand by for location, over!

Recruit Russell,\
what's our location?

It was all down to me.

I had to remember\
what that tree was called.

Tango Five?

No, Tango Six?

Tango Seven!

We're next to Tango Seven, over!

Great work, Recruit Russell.

Oh, no! Negatives on the dust-off,\
Tango Seven.

LZ is no good!

I think he was saying the chopper\
had to land somewhere different.

Recruit Russell,\
we've got to get to that field!

How?\
Run!

One thing I can do is run.

I'm a Jack Russell!

Whoa!

Get to the chopper!\
OK!

Good thing we did\
all those push-ups.

We made it!\
Great work, Recruit Russell!

(BOTH LAUGH)

I can see why Rusty\
liked calling for dust-offs.

Why did you come to this school?

Was there something wrong\
with your old school?

No.

There's something wrong with me.

I'm not good at doing what I'm told,

I can't sit still

and I can't remember anything,\
like numbers or letters or my hat.

Oh.

Well, you're really good\
at playing army.

We're back from patrol, Calypso.

You're all safe.\
Good boy, Rusty.

Congratulations, Recruit Russell.\
You're now Private Russell.

I was in the army.

Come on, you can sit next to me.

And then it was pick-up time.

See you tomorrow, Rusty.

And now I'm here.

Wow, that was a lot of detail.\
Yeah.

Good boy, Jack.

Oh, can I have my condensed milk\
now?

Where'd you get condensed milk from?

Rusty gave it to me.

See you, Jack!

DAD: Hey! Rusty!

His dad brought it back from patrol.

Oh-ho! That was a big one.

Charming.

Mum, can you and Dad smoochy kiss?

Yup.

Not so fast.

Why do you want us to smoochy kiss?

Because we like it.

Yeah, it's very romance.

Where did you learn that word?

TV.

We know all about romance.

Well, maybe you could teach\
your dad about that.

(NAIL FLIES OFF)\
Outrageous!

Yeah, let's teach Dad!

We can set up the restaurant.

The Fancy Restaurant!

Yeah!

This episode of Bluey\
is called Fancy Restaurant.

I'll show you a thing or two\
about romance.

Ooh, can't wait.

Hello.

Welcome to the Fancy Restaurant.

Are you husband and wife?

Yes, we are.

No, we aren't.\
Huh?

This is our first date.

We met five minutes ago.

Very good. Do you have a booking?

Ah, yes.

The name's Romeo McFlourish.

Hmm, Romeo.

Nope, never heard of you.

Oh. Well, can we have a table anyway?

You'll have to make a booking.

Well, I'd like to make\
a booking, please.

No, you have to call.

Ugh. OK.

Boop. Ring-ring.

Hello?

Hi. I'd like to make a booking,\
please.

Name?

Romeo... Oh, uh, what was it?

McFlourish.\
McFlourish. Of course.

OK, great. See you soon.

Bee-boop.

Hi, do you have a booking?

Yes, McFlourish.

Oh, yes. Right this way, please.

Finally.

Smooth, Romeo.

I have, of course, taken you to\
the fanciest restaurant in town.

Baked beans.

Oh, dear.

Not yet, Chef Bingo.

Have they smoochy kissed yet?

No, not yet.

I'm so sorry.

She's new.

Now, these are the menus.

You also have some forks and spoons.

Told you this place was fancy.

Now, what would you like to order?

Could you tell me\
what the special is?

Mm, I'm not sure.

I'll check with the chef.

HEY, CHEF!

What?

What's the special?

The WHAT?

THE SPECIAL!

The WHAT?

There's no special.

I'll just have the baked beans,\
then.

Very good. I'll be right back.

Please enjoy your cutlery.

Ah, excuse me.

I'll be right back.

Hey, dodgy brothers.

Haven't you got anything\
other than baked beans?

What's wrong with baked beans?

Well, they're not very romance.

Hmm. Yeah, I guess we could\
make something else.

Something special?

Yeah, something special.

Ooh, and I'll play\
some romance music.

(GIGGLES)\
Leave it to us.

Now go and do a smoochy kiss.\
Hey!

Oh. I'm back.

So, has the romance started yet?

Very soon, my darling...\
Uh, what's your name again?

Oh! Super smooth.

(ANNOYING MUSIC)\
Ooh!

Ooh, what's this?

Some romance music.

Oh. It's...lovely!

So, ah...\
Hey.

Tell me more about...\
Let go!

..your stuff.

If you'll excuse me.

What? You're leaving me?

I'm just going to the bathroom.

Oh, yes, it's just in that corner\
next to the bookshelf.

Oh. Fancy.

Why haven't you smoochy kissed her\
yet?

Well, how can I when you're\
making all that racket?

You need to be more romance.

I'm trying.

I think I've just\
forgotten my moves.

I guess it has been a while.

Well, toughen up, Romeo.

We wanna see a smoochy kiss.

Ooh. This looks special.

I'm back.\
Very good, madam.

Ah, so, did you have a nice time\
in the toilet?

Excuse me?

Bluey, I need you!

Just a moment.

Be. Romance.

Wow. So beautiful.

I made a special.

You used real food.\
Is that special?

Yeah, that's really special.

(CRICKETS CHIRPING)

(ICE CLINKS)

There's no romance coming, is there?

Ugh. No.

I'm sorry.

I may have forgotten\
how to be romance.

Well, I have too.

It's not easy when you're\
tired all the time.

Yeah, and when you get\
interrupted every five...

Dinner!

Here's your baked beans.

And here's your special dinner.

Wow.

That is...special.

Our chef made this\
especially for you.

Oh, you shouldn't have.

Here you go, madam.

Thank you.

Mm, so good.

You can't just eat it pretend.

Yeah, you have to eat it\
for real life.

Oh.

Um, the thing is...

You don't like it?

Um, well I do, but...

You don't think it's special.

Um, uh...

It's just...

Um...

Hang on.

I know this isn't very romantic,\
but can we swap?

Yours looks delicious.

Oh, OK. I guess we could.

To romance.

Ohh. Ugh, it's great.

You have to finish it.

Oh.

OK.

Awww!\
Bleh! (COUGHS)

Oh, so good.

Oh, man.

I can't get enough of this.

(OWL HOOTS)

(SPLUTTERS)

Would you like dessert?

Ah, no!

I mean, uh, this was\
such a special evening.

I feel like taking a moonlit stroll\
with my new love.

They're holding hands.

Eee!

Oh, yes.

The moon is that way.

This way, my special man.

Well, they didn't smoochy kiss,\
but she is rubbing his back.

Yeah, that's still romance.

Yeah.

Blurgh!

Oh, that's too far.

It's not too far.

Why do we have to walk?\
Why can't we just drive?

Hey, Bingo, look at this.\
OK.

It's an itchity grub family.

Ooh, hello, itchity grubs.

They're out for a walk.

I wonder if their legs get tired\
from walking too?

(MUTTERING)\

Your legs must be so tired.

No, you'll just try to eat me.\

Huh?\
Run, run as fast as you can.

You can't catch me,\
I'm the Gingerbread Man.

Is she gonna run all the way home?

Ah, looks like it.

(PANTS) Come on, you lot,\
get after her.

Yeah, it's good exercise.

Looks like her legs\

I was gonna give her a piggyback.

Well, if there's one going...\

Dancing!\

Mmm. I'm a good dancer!

But...

Very well.

I don't remember\
the Queen being there.

You wouldn't.

Then suddenly this big blue guy\
called, um...

Bandit!\
Bandit walked in.

Alright, here we go.

♪ Doo-do-do-do-do. ♪

Hey, babe, smell this!

What?!\
Spot-on.

Ooh, delightful!

Yes, jolly good.

Who wrote this?

And then, Bandit asked Chilli\
to marry him

on a romance trip to, um...

Italy!\
The dump!

What?\
Ooh, marry me, babe!

Ooh, why should I?\
'Cause I love you, babe.

I love your ears, babe.

Do you love my stinky feet?

Oh, yeah, I loves your stinky feet.

And my bellybutton?

Oh, yeah, I loves your\
bellybutton, babe.

That is not how it happened!\
Oh, yes, it was.

They had a big wedding.

And then... Come on, Bingo!

Is this a toilet break?\
No!

Bluey, I haven't\
ruined the show yet.

Good one, Bingo!

Well, I'm enjoying this very much.

I have some minor quibbles\
with act one, but me too.

And then, Chilli had\
a baby in her belly!

Oh!

It's me.

How are you doing in there,\
little mate?

Kick!\
Ooh!

OK, let's keep this moving!

So, then they...

Bingo!

Ladies and gentlemen, we're\
just having some show problems.

Please, uh...enjoy some dancing.

Oh, no!

Bingo, what are you doing?

Get back out here!

I knew I ruined the show.

It wasn't your fault.

It was.

We can just blow up another one.

Oh, there's no blue ones left.

Oh!

I ruin Mother's Day every day.

There's green!\
But you're not green.

I don't mind. Ooh, I know.\
Let's stuff the Queen up there.

But she's an old lady.\
How rude!

Hey, um...\
No!

Get back to your seat!

I have to go to the toilet!

Sit down!\
Hey! Hey!

Listen, Bingo, we're\
finishing this show.

I can't! Just do it by yourself.

We can't do the show without you.

You're Mum!

Bluey, checklist.

Ooh! OK. Go.

Have a cry.\
Check!

Pick myself up.\
Check.

Dust myself off.\
Check!

And keep going.

The show must go on.\
Check.

She's back.\
Hooray!

Whoo! Whoo! Whoo!

Chilli! Chilli!\
Chilli! Chilli! Chilli!

Er, what? Hey, hey, what?

Save my seat!

So, um...what was happening was...

Yeah!

Chilli went to hospital and...

Are you ready?\
No!

Yes!

She had a baby girl.

Goo-goo, ga-ga.

I'm going to call her Bluey.

That's me!

Ah, yeah, I'm you, aren't I?

Let's see.

Daddy, me go boom-boom in nappy!

Change me, Daddy!

Dada, change me!

The end.

# "Tickle Crabs" (Season 2 Episode 20)
It has been 10 minutes

since a kid has run in here\
and asked me a question.

Dad?\
Yeah, mate?

Can we get married?\
Nah.

Why not?\
I'm already married to your mum.

Because she's your true love?

Yes, because she's my true love.

Is it nice having a true love?

It's very nice having a true love.

What's so nice about\
having a true love?

Hmm. Well, they're always there\
for you when you need them.

Let's play ticklecrabs!\
Yeah, ticklecrabs!

Ooh!\
See you later!

This episode of Bluey\
is called Tick...

Uh-uh. No way.

I am NOT playing ticklecrabs.

Oh, why not?

Because I hate ticklecrabs.

Why?\
Because you're ticklecrabs!

(BOTH GIGGLE)\
Yeah, but that's the fun part.

Fun for you, maybe. Not for me.

OK, Bingo, this is going to take\
a serious please face.

Yes, serious.

Let's get these ears back.

And I'm going to need to see tears.

That's good. And let's hold these.

OK, let's do this.

(CLEARS THROAT)\
What do you want?

Why do you never play with us?

What?!

You're always at work.

I'm never at work!

It's like you don't even love us.

You are joking, right?

How can you not love\
your own children?

Ah, cheese and jam! Alright.

BOTH: Hooray! (GIGGLE)

That was impressive.

This episode of Bluey\
is called Ticklecrabs.

Oh, what a wonderful day\
at the beach.

A little bit lonely, of course,\
but wonderful.

(LOUDLY) It would be better if I had\
a true love to share it with.

Perhaps one day I'll find her.

Oh, well, now it's time\
to go back to my empty house.

I'll just turn around\
and pick up my towel.

(GRUNTS)\
(KIDS GIGGLE)

Now I'll just shake the sand off.\
Now off home.

(GROANS)

Brrrrrrm.

♪ Oh, where are you, my true love?

♪ Won't you come to me? ♪

Ah, home sweet, lonely home.

Ah, well, time for a nap.

Perchance I will dream\
of meeting my true love.

(SNORES)

(GIGGLES)

(WHISPERS) Tickle, tickle, tickle,\
tickle, tickle, tickle.

(SNORES)

BOTH: TICKLE!\
Argh! (LAUGHS)

What was that?!\
(KIDS GIGGLE)

Hm. I must have dreamt\
of being tickled.

Oh, well, I might just give\
this big soft belly a bit of air.

BOTH: TICKLE!\
Argh! (LAUGHS)

Oh, no! Ticklecrabs!

I must have brought\
them back from the beach with me.

(KIDS SQUEAL AND GIGGLE)\
(LAUGHS)

Tickle, tickle!\
(LAUGHS)

(THUD!)\
Ooh!

(LAUGHS)\
Tickle, tickle!

(PANTS)\
BOTH: Tickle, tickle, tickle.

You can get me up here, ticklecrabs!

Tickle, tickle, tickle, tickle!

Hey! What? No!

These ticklecrabs are smart!

(LOUDLY) If only I had a true love\
to come to my rescue!

I've got to make a break for it!

Freedom!

Argh!\
(THUD!)

Tickle, tickle, tickle, tickle!\
Ha-ha!

(PANTS) Hang on, I'll use this glue.

BOTH: Tickle, tickle, tickle,\
tickle.

Got ya!\
(SQUEALS)

Glue, glue, glue. Stick!\
(GIGGLES)

Glue, glue, glue. Stick!

BOTH: Tickle, tickle,\
tickle, tickle.

Well, that seems to have done it.

Ooh, you want some of these\
big juicy ribs?

Ooh, yeah, they look nice to tickle,\
don't they?

Mmm.\
Unglue, unglue, unglue.

BOTH: Pop! TICKLE!

Argh! Ah, true love,\
are you out there?

(LAUGHS)

I could really use you right now

to come and have your turn\
with these ticklecrabs.

Hey... (LAUGHS) ..that's enough.

Time out! (PANTS)

(SIGHS)

Hey, what are you doing in here?\
Hiding.

There's no way I'm getting tickled.

Well, it's nice to meet you.

My name is Telemachus\
and I'm looking for my true love

who's supposed to always\
be there for me

to come and help me\
with these crabs.

But she hasn't turned up.

That sounds like hard work.

How so?

Well, your true love\
probably has her own problems.

Hm, I never thought of that.

I guess the first thing I do\
is yell out for help when I'm...

Good luck!\
Hey!

KIDS: Tickle, tickle!

TICKLE!\
Argh! That is it!

(LAUGHS) That lady was right.

From now on,\
I'll solve my own problem.

You ticklecrabs are going back\
to where you came from!

Just...gotta...take the...\
(LAUGHS) ..hits!

(LAUGHS)

Now I'll just... (LAUGHS)\
..throw them back...

(LAUGHS) ..into the sea!

KIDS: Argh!

Oh, and a big wave\
takes them out to sea.

I did it!

I got rid of those tickling crabs.

Ahh!

The air tastes fresher.

Birdsong's sweeter.

(COCKATOOS CRY)

I'm free at last!

Oh, but a wave washes them back in!

Wait, what? No! Hey! No! Get away!

TICKLE!

(LAUGHS)

Oh, well, let it end, then,

on this... (LAUGHS)

..beautiful day... (LAUGHS)

..alone but... (LAUGHS)\
..no longer lonely.

(LAUGHS)

(SQUEAK!)\
Huh?

(SQUAWKS)

A seagull!

(SQUAWKS)

(SQUAWKS)

The most beautiful seagull\
I've ever seen!

Argh!\
(SQUAWKS)

Tickle, tickle, tickle!

(KIDS SQUEAL AND GIGGLE)

Oh, beautiful seagull,\
are you my true love?

(CHATTERS)

Oh, I'm so happy!

Farewell! We shall meet again!

I will always be there for you,\
for you are my true love.

But I just need half an hour\
on the couch. See ya!

# "Escape" (Season 2 Episode 21)
(THEME MUSIC)

Where are we going?

We're dropping you kids off\
at Nana's, remember?

BOTH: Hooray! TV!

No TV.

What? Why not?

'Cause you've been watching it\
all morning.

But what are we meant to do?

I don't know. Use your imaginations\
and draw some pictures.

But I don't know what to draw.\
Oh, nonsense.

Don't worry, Bingo,\
Nana will let us watch TV.

I heard that.

Hey, hang on.\
Why aren't you coming to Nana's?

Because your dad and I\
wanna spend some time together.

What?! Without us?

Yeah, hard to believe, isn't it?

What are you gonna do?

Well, we're gonna lie in\
comfy hammocks, wearing sunglasses.

Drinking from coconuts\
with those little umbrellas.

With no kids allowed.

Yeah, no kids allowed.

BOTH: What?!

This episode of Bluey\
is called Escape.

This is outrageous!

Yeah. We're gonna come and join in.

You can't stop us!

Oh, no! Here come the kids!

BOTH: Yah!

Well, we've got a huge wall\
that pops up

and it's ten hundred metres tall.

Nice one, Dad.

A wall? Why?

I told you - no kids allowed.

Well, we hire an eagle to fly\
us up over the wall.

(GIGGLES)\
Oh, what?!

Well, on the other side of the wall

is a huge prickle bush\
with big prickles.

Oh, good thinking.

And you can't pay the eagle again\
'cause you've run out of money,

and anyway, he's on the toilet.

Well, then...

..I brought a lawnmower with me

and I'm gonna mow\
the prickle bush down.

Mowwww!

Oh, no.

Good one, Bingo.

OK, we go down a secret tunnel\
to our underground base.

Which also has hammocks.

Well, we go down the tunnel too.

You can't. There's a manhole cover,\
which is locked.

Well, I get an axe\
and chop a hole in it.

It's made of metal.

Your axe breaks.

Hmm, what chops through metal?

Uh, diamond?

Bandit, don't help them!\
Sorry.

Hee-hee! We use a diamond axe\
and chop through it.

Hooray!

Oh, no!\
Quick! Time to bail!

We get in a car.

Yeah, but a cool car.

Let's go, let's go, let's go!

Whoo-hoo-hoo!

Bluey, let's get\
in the dream house car.

Oh, yeah.

The what?\
(DRAMATIC VOICE) The dream house car.

It's like a giant dream house\
on wheels.

Yeah, it's got 11 burger shops

and 20 bedrooms and 40 toilets.

And a spa on the balcony.

Who's driving it?

Butlers.\
Butlers?!

Oh, no. Punch it, Mum!\
Punching it!

Faster, butlers!

Come on! They're gaining!\
I can't go any faster!

Hi.\
(SCREAMS)

Right, that's it.

We drive into the airport and get\
in a helicopter and we fly off.

See you later!

Well...

..we push a button

which makes the wheels of the\
dream house turn into rockets

and we fly into the air.

Who made this thing?!

Jerry Lee.\
He's our science butler.

(BOTH SHOUT)\
Dad! Get us out of here!

I'm trying! I only just learned\
how to fly this thing.

(BOTH GIGGLE)

That's it. We're punching out.

Ooh! So do we!

But we have special parachutes

that still have the spa\
attached to them.

And Jerry Lee is there fanning us.

(BOTH GIGGLE)

That Jerry Lee sure earns his money.

Well, we leg it!

We throw cupcakes at you.

Ooh, good. I eat them.

And we're getting away.

But, you run into a big cliff

that's a million, million miles high.

We're trapped!

BOTH: Thanks, Jerry Lee.

Aha!\
(BOTH YELL)

You've got nowhere to run now.\
(LAUGHS EVILLY)

OK, you win.

We give up. You caught us.

Uh, no.

You have to keep trying to get away.\
What?

But you caught us.\
We'll play with you.

No, we like it\
when you run away from us.

Oh, don't be silly. Give us a hug.

BOTH: No!\
Run, Bingo!

(BOTH YELL)\
Quick - they're getting away!

We run as fast as we can.\
We're chasing you.

We jump on a scooter\
that's electricity.

Well, we get on a scooter\
that's electricity,

but we've paid Jerry Lee\
to pull us on a motorbike too.

Oh! Jerry Lee, you work for us!

Not anymore. We gave him our coconut\
drinks so he likes us better now.

We scoot to the place\
where rockets take off

and we jump in one\
and take off to space.

Yeah, well, we jump onto the tail.

We just want to love you!

(BOTH GIGGLE)

Well, we go up into space.

Yeah, where there's no air.

Dad, quick - take a big breath!

(BOTH TAKE BIG BREATHS)

They can't hold it forever.

BOTH: Hooray!

Oh, you got away!

BOTH: Hooray!\
We win.

BINGO: We go and live on the moon.

(BOTH GIGGLE)

Well done.

BANDIT: We're here!\
Hi, girls!

Have fun with Nana.\
BOTH: We will.

Thanks, Mum.

You two make the most of it.

It's not easy\
getting time to yourselves.

It certainly isn't. See ya, kids.

BOTH: See ya!

Nana, can we watch TV?

Well, OK. If that's what you want.

(GIGGLES)

No, Bingo, let's draw.

Oh, OK.\
Oh. Ooh. OK.

I'll get the pens and paper.

Ooh. And what's this one, Bingo?

It's the dream house car.

That's what we chased\
Mum and Dad in.

Oh, the dream house car.

That's the spa, see?

It has a little dome on it.

(GIGGLES)\
Oh, it does, too.

And this is Jerry Lee.\
Oh, Jerry Lee parachuting.

Got it.\
He's one of our butlers.

And this is us on the moon.

Oh, goodness, you kids\
have got good imaginations.

BOTH: Yes, Nana.

I don't know where\
you get your ideas from.

Mum, can you play with me?

No - I have to clean\

Eww!

Well, it's gotta be done.

Wouldn't you rather play?

It looks like hard work.

Your mum's not afraid\

Ooh, I'm terribly sorry,\
Your Majesty.

Cheeky butler.

I like being the butler better.

Aww! But I like being the butler -

you get to walk\
on the butler blocks.

Uh...maybe we can both be butlers.

OK.

Hmm, this isn't working.

Yeah. Butlers need someone\

Oh, bless you, Your Majesty!\
Bless you!

And thank you\

You're welcome.

Oh, it must be nice being the queen.

Actually, it's not.

Really?

No. I'd rather be the butler.

Guess you do have a lot of\

And you're always having to do\
things you don't want to.

That must be hard work.

Yes, it's a big job.

(NORMAL VOICE) Don't you ever\
feel like...running off to play?

A queen does not just\
run off to play!

Oh, no, Your Majesty,\

Sorry!\

says to put cardboard down.

Oh, righto.

Yallup. Yallup, yallup.\
Yallup.

Of course it's my fault.\

Good idea. You make a start on the\
chair bit and I'll finish the frame.

Yeah. Pretend we're good\
at this sort of stuff.

(THUD!)

BOTH: Oooh.

Bingo, look!

It's one of those.

Pretend we're builders.\
Yeah!

Build, build, build, build.

Teenager, the library is finished.

Wonderful, Mama, but I'm not a\
teenager anymore, I'm all grown up.

Oh, OK.

Look, Mum, I built a spaceship\
to go and explore space.

Oh, you're always\
such a clever thing.

Fly over my dad's house!

He has a pool!

Oh, yeah, I can drop you in it.

We're going down!

We're not going down, we're goin' up.

Please can we go down, Bluey?

It's my helicopter\

It's just part of our game\

It's more fun.

Well, um...

OK, we can go down.\
Thanks, Bluey.

We're going down!\
Hold on.

Arggh!

Good luck.\
Thanks.

Fix, fix, fix. Hi, Indy.

Hi, Bluey.

Can you rescue these kangaroos\
from the bushfire?

Boing-boing-boing-boing.

This helicopter's too small\
for all those kangys.

Oh, yeah. Um...

Can we pretend it's a plane?\
Planes are bigger.

Oh, it's just...

I was playing helicopter.

Oh, OK. Um...

Sorry, kangys. There's no room.

Hmm...\
Boing.

Actually, it's fine.

It can be a plane.\
Hooray!

Get ready to take off.

We escaped the bushfire.

Land. There you go.

You can live here.\

Looks fun.

Ooh, can I have your plane?

Um...sure, that's fine.\
Thank you.

Bye.

Thank you, helicopter/plane.

Boing-boing-boing-boing.

Hey, sweetheart. Ooh.

How was your day?

Good. Are we going to Honey's now?

# "Grandad" (Season 2 Episode 27)
Make sure you eat\
your pumpkin seeds, Bluey -

I want you to grow up\
big and strong.

Aw! I don't want\
to grow up big and strong.

Too bad.

Shouldn't it be up to me?

If it was up to you,\
would you eat them?

No.\
Then, no, it shouldn't be up to you.

Aww!

When we get to Grandad's,\
can he take us in his canoe?

No, honey.

Grandad's just had heartworm.\
The doctor says he needs to rest.

Grandad!

Dad! What are you doing?!

Oh, struth! Quick! Run, kids!

You're meant to be resting!

This episode of Bluey\
is called Grandad.

Aren't you meant\
to be resting, Grandad?

Ah, there's nothing wrong with me.

You get in bed now!\
You'll have to catch me first!

Yeah! You'll have to\
catch us first!

Aaagh!

We gotta head bush, kids!

Get back here!

Oh, no! She's following us!\
Quick! Hide!

Where are those cheeky dogs?

Shh!

No-one knows this scrub\
better than me!

Oh, that's true.\
This is where she grew up.

I will find you!

Grandad! I've got a plan!

I didn't hear any of that.

Ooh! They're over here!

She's gone.\
Nice work, Bluey.

Where should we go?\
To the canoes!

Oh, good idea, Bingo. Come on.

We'll follow the creek.

Come on, Grandad.\
Yeah, yeah.

Just guarding our rear\
from a sneak attack.

I'll show you a trick\
I learned in the jungle.

She can't find what she can't see!

Wow!

Good idea, Grandad.

Are you sure you're OK, Grandad?\
Yeah, yeah, I'm fine.

Is it much longerer to the canoes?

I'm hungry.\
Yeah, me too.

Have you got any food?

Do I have food? Follow me.

Huh!

Grandad, why did you bury a backpack?

In case you need some food.

Hooray!

Oh, come on!

Do you want me to do it, Grandad?\
OK.

My thumbs pull up a bit these days.

Is that what Mum wants you to rest -\
so your thumbs get better?

Yeah, probably.

Then why don't you?

Well, it should be up to me -\
they're my thumbs.

Yes, it should.

Here, Bluey -\
have some pumpkin seeds.

No, thanks.

You've gotta eat\
your pumpkin seeds, kid.

They'll make you big and strong.

That's what Mum says.

Well, your mum's right.

But shouldn't it be up to me?

I'll eat my pumpkin seeds.

I want to be big and strong

so I can paddle the canoe.

Ha! There you are!\
Agh!

She's found us! Run, kids!

You're not meant to be\
running around!

The canoe's down this way!

Ah, now, hang on -\
did I lend it to Maynard?

Come on, Grandad! She's coming!

Oh, I can't remember.\
We'll just go this way.

Hey! What's going on?

Hi, Maynard.\
Hey, kids.

Maynard! You've gotta hide us!

Is it the aliens?

No. It's Chilli.

Grandad won't do\
what Mum tells him to.

Oh, why don't you just\
do what you're told?

Oh, don't you start. Just hide us.

OK. Come on, quickly.\
Come in the back.

Have you got Grandad's canoe,\
Maynard?

Here I come!\
Bingo! Come on!

Oh, Chilli! Fancy seeing you here.

Can it, Maynard. Where are they?

Um... Where's who?

You know who.\
Um...

Did you get a haircut?

Come on, Maynard. Keep it together.

He has to accept\
that he's getting older

and needs to look after himself.

Well, IF he was here, he'd just say,\
"Shouldn't it be up to me?"

No, it shouldn't.

I'm his daughter.

He should take care of himself\
for me, because...

..I still need him.

Well, only an old fool\
would ignore that!

Oh! Is that a bite, Maynard?

Oh, we're cooked, kids!

I think that IS a bite.

It could be a barra.

Oh, yeah. That's definitely a barra.

Aagh! I got it, I got it, I got it!

You had one job, Maynard!

You!\
Run, kids!

Where?

Canoe!

Yaah!\
Don't you ever quit?!

Run, Grandad!\
I AM running!

Get back here!

Yaa-ah!\
Yah!

Whoo-hoo!

We got away!\
Hooray!

Rrr...rah!\
Aagh!

Don't you ever quit?!

What are we gonna do?

We canooooe!

Paddle, Grandad!

I can't - my thumbs!

You kids'll have to do it.

This is why you have to go rest.

Well, this is why YOU\
have to be big and strong.

She's catching up!\
Canooooe!

Canooooe! Canooooe!\
That's it, girls! We're doing it!

Canooooe! Canooooe!\
Yeah! We got away!

I'll find you!

Whoo-hoo!

That was fun.

Yeah. I could've used you kids\
with me in the jungle.

Will Mum find us here?

Yeah. She'll be here soon, I reckon.

This was her favourite place\
when she was young.

Where should we go?\
Should we get back in the canoe?

Nah.

I think it's time I had a rest.

Why don't you kids have a swim?

Yeah! Swim!

Hey, Grandad, watch me!

Whee!\
Oh, good one, Bluey.

That's the way, Bingo.

Caught you.

I knew you would.

Mum, look - I'm eating\
my pumpkin seeds!

Hooray!

And Grandad's resting.

Hooray.

I remember when you used to\
take ME swimming here.

Yeah, me too.

That was a long time ago.

No.

It was yesterday.

Nah, it's just some monkeys\
in a tree.

Hey, Chubbles, look what I invented.

We can use it to explore\
the Groundlands.

Oh, Chunky.\
You and your inventions.

(LAUGHS)

Bingo, sit still.

Why can't you just be like\
the rest of us?

Why do you have to be SO different?

I don't know.

(SINGS) ♪ I wish I wasn't\
different... ♪

Oh, man, there's songs.

♪ I wish I were the same... ♪\
Ow, my popcorn.

One popcorn, please.

Sure.\
Bingo, don't touch that.

Dad, am I different, like Chunky is?

Huh?

Uh, yeah, well, uh, no.

Bingo, no, mate.

I think I am different.

I'm the only one of my friends\
who doesn't watch movies.

I wish I wasn't different.

Look, mate, I'm pretty sure\
that by the end of the movie,

everyone will like that\
the monkey was different.

Ow!\
(KIDS LAUGH)

Don't spill 'em, Bingo.\
Don't spill 'em.

Well, I am not gonna\
be different anymore.

I'm ready for movies.

Just like everyone else.

The Groundlands aren't for chimps.

Tree World is where we belong.

But my heart belongs\
to the Groundlands.

I don't care...

Can I sit over there?\
No, mate, we're sitting here.

But I want to go down there.\

No, you have to stay here with me.\
No, you have to stay here with me.

Huh?

Hi.

Hey!\

Uh, well, uh, you know.

Bit muddy out there.

This episode of Bluey\

Hi, Bluey. Hi, Bingo.

BOTH: Hi, Muffin.

What are you playing?

We're playing Library.\
I'm the library lady.

This is my desk.

I've got a stamp...\
and a computer.

And this is the book dooter,\
where you get your books out.

And this is where you\
return those books.

Oh.

This is a sign to say,\
"No talking loud."

Uh, that's it.

Oh, wait. These are the books.

(LOUDLY) Wow!\
Shh!

Can I play?

Sure, let's get you a library card.

OK!\
Shh!

I'll just take your picture.

Look into this and smile.

Click!

Excellent.

Just waiting for it to be ready.

There you go.

I want a pink one!

Shh!

(WHISPERS) Library cards are orange.

But I want a pink one!

OK, I'll do a pink one.

Feel free to choose some books.

Just remember to keep quiet.

OK!

Ooh.\

Cat Squad is here!

Cat Squad!

Muffin, shush!

Fear not, we are here\
for your purr-tection.

Miaow!

Muffin!\
Brum!

You can't ride the Cat Squad bike\
in the library.

Yes, I can!

(HONKS HORN)\
Stop it! Cut it out!

(TURNS OFF BIKE)\
Hey!

I'm sorry, library customer.

Here's your library card, Muffin.

Ooh, pink.\
Yes, it's pink.

Now, you can borrow\
any books you want.

Ooh!

I want pop-up book!

Argh! No!\
Muffin! You can't have that one.

But, you know...\
Dad!

Yes, Muffy?

Bluey isn't letting me play Library.\
Oh.

Bluey!\
Yes, Mum?

Can you include Muffin\
in your game, please?

We are, but she's\
not playing properly.

Well, everyone has their\
own way of playing, Bluey.

Just let Muffin play\
how she wants, OK, honey?

OK.

Here you go.

Hooray! Rarr!

Doot!

So, Muffin...\
Doot!

..to borrow books,\
doot the corner like that.

OK.

The library rules are...

..you can doot three books out\
at a time.

Argh!

Rah! Rah!

Uh, Muffin, that's too many books.\
Rah!

I can play however I want.

Da-da-da, da-da-da.\
Oh, yes, I forgot.

OK, children,\
welcome to Toddler Time.

(QUIETLY) Yay.

Now, there aren't any books left

because Muffin has borrowed them all.

(SHOUTS) Zebras are stripy!

But I did find this one\
in Dad's office,

but it doesn't have any pictures.

(DISAPPOINTED) Oh!

there was some words..."

Ah!

Poppy!

(SIGHS) I'm sorry, children,\
but she's allowed to do that.

Attention, library customers,\
your books are due back now.

Please put them in\
the book mouth thing. Thank you!

You too, Muffin.

No, I'm keeping them.

You can't keep library books,\
Muffin.

If you don't return them,\
other people can't borrow them.

Everyone else has to return them,\
but I get to keep them.

Why do you get to keep them?

'Cause I am the most special kid\
in the world.

(BOOK PLAYS\
THE ANTS GO MARCHING ONE BY ONE)

That's it!

You can be noisy,\
you can borrow all the books,

you can even eat toddlers,

but you have to return your books.

Otherwise, you're not\
playing library properly.

(BOOK PLAYS\
THE ANTS GO MARCHING ONE BY ONE)

A couple weeks later\
and it's still there.

What's up, gang?

Muffin's not playing properly.

Bluey, we spoke about this.

Muffin can play how she wants.

But we're playing Library\
and she won't return her books.

She said she doesn't have\
to follow the library rules.

Oh.

Did she say why?

She says 'cause she's\
the most special kid in the world.

Oh. Oh, OK.

I'll be right back.

Hey, Muffy.

(ANNOYED) Hey!

You know how I said you're the most\
special kid in the world?

Yes.

Well...you're not.\
Oh.

I mean, you are to me and your mum.

We love you more than anything.

But you're probably not special\
to everyone else.

Oh, OK.

So you have to follow\
the same rules as everyone, OK?

OK, Dad.\
Thanks, kiddo.

Bluey, guess what?\
What?

I'm not special anymore.

BLUEY AND BINGO: Hooray!

Can we play library again?\
I promise I'll return my books.

BOTH: Yeah!

Ooh!

Shh!

The end.

BINGO AND MUFFIN: Yay!

You have a good time\

OK.

I'll make the dam.\
Here's a good one.

Oh, yeah, that'll go fast.

Hi, Mia. Hi, Mia. Hi, Mia.

How old are you?\
12.

Wow. Can you drive a car?

When do you start big school?\
Next year.

Dear fairies...

Hi.\
Ah! Uh...

Mackenzie, what are you doing here?

He made me come.

Explain yourself.

Oh, I...I thought there might be\
some good bark here

for our barky boats.

Well, there's not. Now... (MUTTERS)

I told you. Come on!

Let's go.\
Bye.

Ugh! That was close.

OK. Dear fairies...

Dad bought new grass\
but it had ants in it

and he couldn't find the ant powder,

and Mum was like,\
"Where'd you last have it?"

And he said...

Oh, look.

Do you think this would make\
a good barky boat?

Um, I guess.

Do you wanna just quickly give it\
to Mackenzie?

No!

Come on, Bluey, I'll race you.

Keep letting the water build up.\
OK.

And no running off.

Yeah, OK.

I don't know what I was thinking.

Hi.\
Ah!

Ah!\
Sorry, Mackenzie.

What are you doing here?

She made me come.

I thought you might like\
this barky boat.

Oh, thanks. That's a good one.

It's not that good.\
It's gooder than yours.

Is not.

I can find a better one.\
I'll help you.

OK.

Won't be long, Mackenzie.\
I'll be right back, Bluey.

BOTH: Hey.

Aww...

Aw, Bluey, Mackenzie.\
Where are your buddies?

They ran away from us.

Oh, goodness me.

Don't they like us?

Of course they do.

But...it can be hard being\
12 years old sometimes.

What do you mean?

Here, give me those barky boats.\
I'll show you something.

Go on. Hold the water back.

There once were two six-year-old\
buddies floating around,

nice and calm,

not a care in the world.

They turned seven years old,\
then eight years old,

then nine, then 10, then 11, then...

I can't hold it any longer!\
Look out!

Whoo! Off they went,\
on a big adventure.

Hang on, buddies.\
BOTH: Yeah, hang on, buddies.

They went this way. And that way.

Ah! Are they gonna make it?

And they lived happily ever after.

Just be patient, children.

Your buddies haven't forgotten you.\
OK, Calypso.

Maybe there's some bark here.

Yeah, there usually is.

Ooh, lilly pillies.

Let's pick some for our buddies.\
OK.

What's your favourite fruit?

Uh... Lychees.

What's yours?\
I like mangoes.

Are you going to go back\
to your fairy garden?

Um...no.

It's not as much fun\
without my buddy.

Yeah, same.

Do you wanna play barky boats\
with me?

Ooh, OK.\
We can race our buddies.

Ready? One, two, three, go.

Ooh!\
Go, Mia!

Are you nervous about\
starting high school?

A little.\
Me too.

At least we'll be there together.

Go Captain!

BOTH: (GASP) Our buddies!

No, Mia won!

No, she didn't. Captain won.

No, he didn't.\
Yes, he did.

(BOTH BLOW RASPBERRIES)

(BOTH LAUGH)

(PANTS) We're back.

BOTH: Hooray!

I'm so sorry, Bluey.

I don't know what happened.

We were looking for barky boats...

We went down this way\
and that way and...

And we found some lilly pillies.

And then, I...I don't know\
what happened.

That's OK.

You made it back.

BOTH: Huh!

Come on, Bluey.\
Let's finish the fairy letter.

OK.

See ya, Mackenzie.\
See ya, Bluey.

ALL: Bye.

Alright, come on.

Let's do the biggest dam ever.

Yeah!

OK, ready, Bluey.

Dear fairies...

Dad bought new grass.

It had ants.

I love my buddy, Mia,

'cause she can do the splits\
and she gives me piggybacks.

Oh, I love giving you piggybacks.

Please get the ants\
out of Dad's grass.

And also, look after Mia\
when she goes to big school,

even though she isn't scared.

And make sure she doesn't forget\
to come and play with me.

Kiss, kiss, kiss. Hug, hug, hug!

or you're not playing, OK?

OK.

Ready.

OK, ladies and gentlemen,\
welcome to the circus.

Our first act today will be...

What should our first act be?

I've got an idea.

OK, you say it.

Our first act will be a lion\
jumping through this hoop.

Ooh.

Jumpy jump, lion.

Come and get your treat.

No, you're a mean lion tamer,\
remember?

Oh, yeah, I forgot.\
Jump, lazy lion!

Rarrr.

Husband, be kind to your lion.

I'm not your husband.

Rarr!

Ta-da!\
Yeah.

No treat for you.

Rarr.

Bluey, Mackenzie doesn't want to be\
my husband.

Mackenzie, can you pretend\
to be Coco's husband?

But I don't want to.

Sorry, Coco, he doesn't want to.

Well, can't you make him?

Ah, no.

Yeah, if he doesn't want to,\
Bluey can't make him.

OK.

Rarr.

Ladies and gentlemen,\
for our next act.

Um, what should our next act be?\
Bluey!

Can I play with you?

Oh, can Winton play circus with us?

Yeah.\
Of course.

Yeah.

Yeah, you can play.\
Whoo!

We need a muscleman.

Can I be a clown instead?

I can do this.

OK, you're a clown.

Yeah, Fluffy the Clown.

Huh? Where's my jump gone?

Hey!

Wait... Wait...

Just give her the treat!

Wait.

Mmm.

Mackenzie!

Rarr. Rarr.

Come back!

Coco, keep doing your thing.

I told him not to be mean\
to that lion.

He-he-he-he.

Winton...

..you're supposed to be my jump.

Yes, I know, but now I'm Fluffy\
the Clown.

Well, I wanna play with you too.

Well, we'll have to ask Bluey.\
She's the ringmaster.

I'm playing.

Ah, OK. I guess you can.

We're playing circus.

No, we're playing motorbikes.

You can all be my jumps.

You can't tell us what to play.

Yes, I can.

Now, lie down, jumps.

Come out here at once,\
you cheeky lion.

Rarr!

Rarr-rarr-rarr.

Hmm, this is a bit boring.

Yeah, let's run away.

No.

Stop!\
What?

You can play with us if you like,\
but you have to play circus.

No!

OK, well then,\
you can't play with us.

You can't tell me what to do.

Yes, I can tell you what to do,\
'cause we were playing first.

Fine.\
I'll just stand here and do this.

Hercules! Stop it!

I'll get some help.

Stop it! That's enough.

Cut it out.\
Hey, what's going on here?

This meanie isn't doing\
what I tell him to.

Oh, don't be so silly.

Hmm?\
Come on, you're just in time.

We need a muscleman\
to help save our lion tamer.

Do as you're told, you stinky lion.

Come on.

Argh. Argh. Ooh.\
Grr.

You meanie lion.

You're not a meanie.

You're a good little lion.

It's you who's the meanie.\
Me?

Yes, you.

Arrrrrgh!

It was just pretend.

Ladies and gentlemen,\
Hercules the Muscleman.

Hooray.

Let's play motorbikes.

Yeah!

Why don't we be the jumps?\
Good idea.

Good snags, kids?

Yeah.

Bingo, do you mind picking up\
your rubbish, mate?

Yes, Dad.\
Cheers, mate.

Ooh, I've got sauce on my fingers.

Oh, that's not good.

Can I wipe it on my fur?

Yeah, go on.

It's a free country.

# "Swim School" (Season 2 Episode 34)
(THEME MUSIC)

I don't need floaties\
'cause I learnt to swim!

Bingo, walking.

Walking.\
Sorry.

Running's a bit dangerous\
by the pool, mate.

Let's play Swim School!

Dad, Bluey's running by the pool.

Bingo, don't be a dobber.

What?!

But you said running by the pool\
is dangerous.

Well...yeah, it is.

So, what if Bluey's doing\
something dangerous?

Should I dob then?

Yeah, but...uhm...

Chilli?\
Mm-mm.

Uh...

Gotta go!

This episode of Bluey\
is called Swim School.

So, there's two classes -\
Little Fish and Big Fish.

Can I play?\
BOTH: Yeah!

You have to pass Little Fish\
before you can go to Big Fish.

Got it?\
ALL: Got it.

OK, children,\
time to meet your teacher.

Hello, darlings. I'm Karen.

ALL: Hi, Karen.

Oh, and you're all\
brothers and sisters.

BOTH: Baagh!

Let's do kicking!

(SPLASHING)

Good kicking, Bingo.

No, no - my name's Merifyndor.

Good kicking, Merifyndor.

♪ Do-do-do-do-do... ♪

Karen, Bevan isn't\
doing it properly.

Bevan?!

Is Bevan doing anything dangerous?

Well, no.

Then don't be a dobber, sweetie.

Sorry, Karen.\
That's OK.

♪ Do-do-do-do-do-da-da... ♪

Ooh!\
(GIGGLES)

Karen! Merifyndor just poked me.

Hands to yourself,\
please, young lady.

Yes, Karen.

Hang on - shouldn't Bevan get\
in trouble for dobbing, like I did?

Oh, yes. Bevan, no dobbing.

Well, shouldn't Sharon\
get in trouble

for dobbing on me\
about dobbing on Merifyndor?

Oh, yes. Bad Sharon. No dobbing.

But I... (GASPS)\
(GIGGLES)

OK, class, two new rules.

First, no more poking.\
Aww!

And second, no more dobbing.

Unless someone's in danger.\
Unless that.

You are a family.

You're right, Karen.

Let's work together,\
brothers and sisters.

BOTH: Yeah!

Doggy paddle!

You're doing well, brother!

Thanks, sister.

How am I doing?

Great, little sis. Keep going.

Very good, poppets.

Oh! You make Karen so proud.

Excellent monkeying.

Oh, you'll be Big Fish in no time.

Aagh!

This is your final lesson -

ninja kicks!

Hi-ya!

ALL: Oh, wow!

Ta-da!

Off you go.

Hi-ya!

Yah!

Hi-ya!

Well done, poppets.

You all get to move up to Big Fish!

ALL: Hooray!

And no-one dobbed on anyone.

Good luck.

Wait - are you not\
our teacher for Big Fish?

Oh, no. Margaret takes Big Fish.

Goodbye!

I have a feeling\
we're not gonna like Margaret.

Surprise!\
ALL: Aagh!

Welcome to Big Fish.

I'm Margaret...

..your teacher.

ALL: Hello, Margaret.

Now, I'm not as nice as Karen.

I knew it.

If anyone steps out of line\
in my class,

you'll get one of these.

Bleagh! Plagh!\
(GIGGLES)

That's called a squirty.

Why'd you demonstrate on ME?

Don't worry about us, Margaret.

Karen taught us to work as a family

and never to dob - unless\
it's about something dangerous.

Oh, yes. Karen doesn't like\
dobbing, does she?

No.

Well, I do.\
ALL: Huh?

In fact, if you don't dob,\
you won't pass.

But I thought dobbing was bad.

Unless you're doing\
something dangerous.

No. Dobbing is good.

Well, we're gonna pass Big Fish\
without dobbing.

Big Fish is pretty hard.

We don't care how hard it is.

Yeah, Marge.\
What do you think about that?

Bleagh!

It's Margaret!

Great backstroke, Bevan!\
Thanks, sis.

Whoo!\
Whoa! What are you doing?!

I'm a bag of coconuts.

Why would I - plagh! - backstroke\
with a bag of coconuts?

You might be shipwrecked\
on an island.

(COUGHS) Blagh!

Fail!

OK, swim to the other side.

BOTH: Go, Sharon!

(SQUEALS)\
I'll just tag along.

Wha...? Bllbb...

Fail!

BOTH: What?!

Great starfish, Merifyndor.

Here comes a cyclone!

(BLOWS)\
(SQUEALS, GIGGLES)

Another fail.

Family meeting.

(SINGS, GARBLED)

Big Fish is impossible!

Yeah. I don't know\
about this Margaret character.

She's a silly old watermelon head!

Yeah!

I want Karen back.

What if we just refuse\
to do what she says?

Yeah!

If we stick together,\
what's she gonna do?

What do you reckon, Merifyndor?

Merifyndor?

And then they said they weren't\
gonna do anything you say,

and that they want Karen back.

Excellent dobbing, sweetheart.

Ugh!\
Blagh!

That's for being cheeky.

Merifyndor!

Did you dob on us?\
(GIGGLES)

It's allowed.\
It sure is.

You just passed Big Fish.

BOTH: What?!

OK, well, SHE called you\
a silly old watermelon head.

You what?!

You fail too.

Eugh! (GIGGLES)

Sharon, come here.

You pass Big Fish instead.

But, uh...Sharon peeked\
in Marco Polo.

What?!\
I did not!

Bleagh!\
Fail!

Ah, I'll just saunter\
over here, then.

Well, Bevan...um...um...

I'll just get ready for a squirty.

Um...

Go on - you've got nothing\
on me, Sharon.

He...he...

He peed in the pool!

(KIDS SCREAM)\
Ew! Ew! Gross!

It's a victimless crime!

You two pass Big Fish.

BOTH: Yes!

You fail, you big grub!

Aww.

Margaret, I don't like\
dobbing on my family.

If Bevan fails Big Fish,\
then I want to fail too.

Hi-ya!

I'm with Merifyndor.

Yah!\
(GIGGLES)

BOTH: Good one, sis!

Well, fine! You all fail!

Thanks, Merifyndor.

You're welcome, Bevan.

Surprise!\
ALL: Aagh! Karen!

Welcome back to Little Fish.

ALL: Aww!

I'm so proud of you all.

Why's the water warmer here?

Aaagh!\
Oh, Bevan!

# "Cafe" (Season 2 Episode 35)
Hello.\
Hi.

Do you want to play cafe?\
Ooh, yes, please.

This can be banana bread.\
Ooh, this one too.

My name's Bluey.\
I'm Winnie. Nice to meet you.

Have you got any brothers\
and sisters?

I've got a sister, Bingo,\
but she sleeps in.

That's why she's not here.\
My sister sleeps in, too.

Oh.\
Ready.

Great. Let's take\
the customers' orders.

What customers?

BOTH: Dad, can you be our customer?

This episode of Bluey\
is called Cafe.

Ooh!\
(GROANS)

Hey, mate. Bandit.\
Fido.

This is a cafe,\
and you two are friends.

What would like you to order?

I'll have a cup of tea, thanks.

Well, we only have\
banana bread, sorry.

Oh, well, uh, I'll have\
some banana bread.

Toasted, please.\
Great.

And what would you like?\
The banana bread's pretty good.

Banana bread. Also toasted.

OK. Two banana bread.\
BOTH: Toasted.

Here you go.\
That's two dollar bucks.

Tap here.\
Boop!

Sorry, that didn't work.\
Oh.

You must be out of money.

Yeah, you spent it all\
on strawberries.

Oh, yeah, I did.\
I'll get it. I've got cash.

Thanks, mate.\
I have a strawberry problem.

This isn't enough money.

This is only enough\
for one banana bread.

You'll have to share.\
(BOTH GIGGLE)

They forgot to toast it.

Well, yeah, they're just a pain\
to maintain, that's all.

Yeah, true.

Dad, can we go to Winnie's house\
for breakfast? She invited me.

Oh, uh, no mate. We've\
gotta get home, actually.

Yeah, we'd better get back too.

OK. Bye, Winnie.

Bye, Bluey.\
(BOTH GIGGLE)

Squeeze me tight.\
Whoa, that's tight.

Nice to meet you, mate.\
Yeah, you too.

Mum, I made a new friend.\
Her name's Winnie.

She likes budgies.\
Oh, she sounds nice.

She is. We played cafe.

But Dad said we couldn't go\
to her house for breakfast.

Well, we'd only just met them.

But Winnie's my friend.\
And you're friends with her dad.

Well, I wouldn't say\
we're friends yet.

Why? Don't you like him?\
Well, yeah, he's a good guy.

So why aren't you friends?

Well, we just need to get to know\
each other a bit better first.

How long will that take?

It'll take as long as it takes.

You sure take a long\
time to make friends.

Well, a cafe's a great place\
to get to know someone.

Wah! (GIGGLES)

Winnie!\
Bluey!

Back for more?\
Gotta be done.

PUPS: Customers.

Yeah, it is a good school, actually.

Here are your chai lattes.

These are sugar packets.\
Ooh, really?

But they're just\
for chai lattes, OK?

You can't just eat them.\
Both: Uh, sure. We won't.

(SQUEALS) They're eating\
sugar packets!

We're made! Run!\
Grab the sugar!

Get 'em, Winnie!\
They're coming!

Quick! Get up here, Bandit! Come on!

Come back here!

Look out. Ooh!

Save the sugar!\
(PUPS LAUGH)

Get up here, Fido!\
Oh, this net!

We'll get you!\
Down here!

(ALL EXCLAIM AND LAUGH)

Put that sugar down!\
No way!

It's for your chai lattes!\
Uh-uh!

Quick, Fido!

And then we chased them around\
the whole playground. (GIGGLES)

Well, it sounds like you all\
had a lot of fun.

Yeah, we did.\
Can I come and play cafe tomorrow?

Yeah, if you get up early.\
OK.

Are you and Winnie's dad\
friends now?

Oh, well, a little bit.

I don't know.\
Eat your breakfast.

(STRAINS) OK, let's go.

I'm up.\
Hey, Bingo!

Oh-ho, no way. So what did you do?

Well, I'm looking at this snake\
and I'm thinking,

"This guinea pig is not looking..."

Granola.\
Oh, thanks.

Hey. There's only one granola.

(PUPS LAUGH)

Oh, I think the staff here\
are just too young.

Well, Fido, we have\
no choice but to...

Oh, Dad, can you push\
me on the swings?

Oh, yeah, sure.

Sorry, mate.\
No worries.

Oh, a bit higher please!

What would you like to order?\
And do you like my dad?

Croissant, please.\
And, yeah, I do like your dad.

Good.\
Because he likes you.

And we're all out of croissants.\
(GIGGLES)

Bingo, are you sure you don't\
want to play cafe?

No, thanks.\
OK.

(SPUTTERS) This is soy milk!\
(PUPS GIGGLE)

And Winnie has seen\
an echidna for real life.

Wow.\
Yeah. That's what I said.

And how's Winnie's dad?

Well, I don't know. I didn't get\
to chat to him much this morning.

Oh, too bad.

Are we almost ready to have\
breakfast with them yet?

Well, not just yet. But soon.

Whoa.

Is Bingo coming?\
No, she's still asleep.

Oh, OK. Well, just us, then.

Come on!

We're going to make disgusting\
smoothies for you and Fido.

Well, we're gonna eat\
all your gingerbread men

and run off without paying.

Oh, they're not here.

Well, I guess they don't\
come every morning.

Here's your smoothie.\
Oh, thanks.

Bloop-bloop-bloop. Bleugh!

(GIGGLES)\
Oh, yuck!

Bleugh!

I wish Winnie was here.\
I know you do.

Do you wish Winnie's dad was here?

Yeah, I do.\
He's good fun, actually.

If you asked Winnie's dad\
to be your friend,

do you think he would say yes?

Well, I don't know. Maybe.

If you weren't my dad,\
I'd want to be your friend.

Oh, thanks, mate.

Come on, we have to\
get back for brekkie.

Bluey!\
Winnie.

Oh, sorry we're late.\
Buggerlugs slept in.

No worries. We were just\
heading back for brekkie.

Oh.\
Oh, OK. No worries.

Well, um...

..would you like to come to\
our house for breakfast?

(BOTH GASP)\
For real life?

Only if it's OK with your dad.

I mean, it's pretty short notice.

Can we, Dad, please?!

Yeah, righto.

PUPS: Yeah!

How long does it take\
to get to your place?

Uh, not too long.\
Here I saved you some smoothie.

Oh, thanks.

# "Postman" (Season 2 Episode 36)
Bluey, do you want to play\
ground's lava?

Where you can't touch the ground?\
Yeah.

OK, I'll just put my plate\
back in the kitchen.

I see what you're saying,\
I just don't agree.

How can you not agree?

Are you two squabbling?\
One second, Bluey.

If you attach the bin to the door,

it means I have to deal\
with the bin bags.

Yeah, but you don't\
have to touch the bin.

But I like taking the whole bin out.

Bin bags are a pain.\
You're a pain.

Oh, great.\
Stop squabbling. I don't like it.

We're not squabbling, kiddo.

We're just talking.\
Sorry, Bluey. It's OK.

Look, let's talk about this later.

Can't wait.

This episode of Bluey\
is called "Postman".

This is your letterbox.

And this is YOUR letterbox.

Here's some letter-writing things,\
and I'm the postie.

Oh, great.

What?

You have to write a letter.\
Oh, OK.

Who should I write it to?

The only other person\
with a letterbox is Mum.

Well, I'd better write one\
to Mum, then.

Yes.

Write that you're not enemies.\
But we're NOT enemies.

Yes, yes, put it in the letter.

We were just having a discussion.\
It was a squabble.

Maybe, but we still love each other.

People shouldn't squabble.

You're probably right.

It's good to get to the bottom\
of things, though.

Well, I'm not going\
to squabble with anyone.

Fair enough. Here you go.

Thank you.

Hey! You're reading my mail?

Ooh, a love heart.

See you.

Arggh, Bluey, stop!\
You're in the lava.

Huh?\
Were playing ground's lava.

Remember?\
Oh, yeah.

But I can't anymore, Bingo.

I'm playing postman.\
Oh!

You'll always say you'll play\
with me, and you never do.

No, I don't.\
Yes, you don't.

No, I d... Wait, this is squabbling!

Um, OK, we can play both, Bingo.

Yay. Thanks, Bluey.

Mm, not squabbling is easy.

This episode of Bluey is called\
"Postman and Ground's Lava".

We need to get to the top deck\
so I can deliver this letter to Mum.

Ugh!\
OK.

But we have to do it\
without touching the lava.

Help me with the bike.

Ahh, it's too heavy.

Can we just leave it here?

You can't be a postie\
without a motorbike.

Yeah, you can.

Postie Petunia\
doesn't have a motorbike.

But she's not real.\
Yes, she is.

She's on TV.\
No, she...

Wait. Is this a squabble?

Uh, yes.

Well, we have to stop it\
'cause I'm never squabbling again.

Oh, OK.

So, you'll just have to agree\
with me on everything, OK?

OK, easy.

Now, grab the bike.\
Yes.

Because posties have motorbikes.

I think I can reach the bottom step.

But they're lava.\
What?!

The steps are lava, too?

Yeah, it's a lava waterfall.

But Mum's upstairs.

I'm making it\
so the steps aren't lava.

Oh, not fair.

You have to agree with me\
on everything, remember?

I think you should agree\
with me on everything.

I don't agree on that.\
Well, I do.

Well, I don't.\
Uh-uh.

We're squabbling.

Oh, yeah.

OK, I'll agree with you\
on everything.

Splendid. The steps are lava.

How are we gonna get up them?

Steppy stones.

Ooh, that's it. Gee, this is fun.

Hooray!

Ooh, good thing we left\
all our stuff on the floor.

OK, let's go this way to the kitchen.

No, let's go over the couches.

But that's the long way.

So?\
There's no time.

I have to give this letter\
to Mum now.

But the couch way is more fun,

and you have to agree\
with me, remember?

Well, I think let's try where I agree\
with me and you agree with you.

Um, OK.

See you at the kitchen.

Oh, no, I'm stuck.

Me, too.\
Look, a lava boat!

But how are we\
gonna get to it?

I know.

Yahh!\
Go, Bluey!

Huh! We made it!

I guess posties do need bikes.

Maybe we should just agree\
with each other on everything.

OK.

Oh, Bingo, this is the only way to\
travel on lava, wouldn't you agree?

Yes, I would agree.

Almost there.

Oh, we can't get over the thing.\
Don't worry.

Mail's here!

Hey, what? Where's Mum?

There she is.

She must have moved.

Oh, we took too long.

Now she'll never get my letter.

Why do you wanna deliver\
this letter so much?

'Cause if I don't, Mum and Dad\
will be enemies forever.

What?!

That's why I didn't wanna play\
ground's lava.

Then why did you?

'Cause you always cry\
when I don't play with you.

Because you always promise to play\
with me, and then you don't.

But I had a reason.\
But you didn't tell me the reason.

'Cause I didn't wanna upset you.

Oh, no.

Bingo, we're squabbling.

I'm sorry, Bluey.\
I'm sorry, too, Bingo.

Hey, that squabble felt good.\
Yeah.

But how will we deliver the letter?\
Hmm...

Bingo!

We can make an aeroplane!\
Yeah!

Open the book.\
OK.

What's the first step?\
Fold it down the middle.

OK.\
Move your foot.

And then fold the top bits.

OK, folding the top bits.

No, no, the other way.\
I'm doing it the other way.

You're not.

No, we're still squabbling.

Yeah.

OK, ready?\
Ready.

And fly!

Go, love-heart plane!

That's it, that's it.

What? No!\
No!

Arggh!

Dad's gonna love Judo's Mum.

Go back, go back.

Phew.\
Thanks, brother wind.

Ohh, that's it.

Hooray!

You have to see how long you can go\
without making a single noise.

Ooh, OK.

You ready?\
Yeah.

OK. Go!

I think you've got the hang of it.

See if you can make it\
till your 13th birthdays.

Bandit, you're a genius.

Honey, Madge just rang in sick.\
I have to get to work.

I'll be on the couch.

No. I need you to go and buy\
a birthday present for Muffin.

Oh, Madge.

Trixie said to get a Moonlight\
Unicorn. She collects them.

But don't get one\
she's already got, OK?

Or she'll go bananas.

Well, how do I know\
which one's she's already got?

The kids know, don't you, girls?

See? They'll tell you. Gotta go.

Hmm, it's quiet in here.

Oh, biscuits.

Hey, you kids want some ice-cream?

Alright. Well, if you\

Good luck\

You're gonna do great. Trust me.

How do you know\
I won't mess it all up?

You won't. Just do your best\

OK, Mum.

Alright. Toy section.

Ah, what's this thing called again,\
kids? Moonbeam something?

Kids?

Oh, yeah, you're still\
playing the Quiet Game.

OK, boop.

I've paused the game so you can\
tell me what toy Muffin wants.

Grr. Look, at least nod\
if I get it right.

Ah, what about this?

How about this one?

Oh, give me a clue. Come on.

OK, yep, moon.

Yes, I knew that one.

Ah, moon roof?

No, moon ceiling. Moon sprinkler?

Hey, mate, have you got a toy\
called a Moon Sprinkler?

Ah, I don't know, sorry.

It's my first day today.\
I can check out the back.

Thanks, mate. OK, where was I?

Moon.

Moon truck?

Moon headlight.

Moon light? Moonlight.

Oos. Mmm, horse.

No? Not horse.

That's a horn.\
Horses don't have horns.

Wait. Unicorn. Moonlight Unicorn.\
Boom.

Ha-ha-ha.

OK, where are\
the Moonlight Unicorns?

There's thousands of them.

And they're all different.

Appledate. Pebbledasher.

Do you know which one Muffin wants?

Can you tell me?\
No, you can't tell me.

Can you point at it? Grr.

Look, kids,\
you win the Quiet Game, OK?

Hooray. Gold medal, gold medal.

You can talk now.

Grr. Look, the Quiet Game\
isn't actually a real game.

I made it up\
'cause you kids were too noisy.

I'm sorry, I'm a dodgy dad.

So that means you can talk now?

Arghh. Forget this.

Bramblehop. He'll do.

So, Muffin gets a unicorn\
she's already got.

What's the worst that can happen?

Huh?

OK, you're Muffin. Got it.

It's your birthday.\
You get your present.

You unwrap it. It's Bramblehop.

Oh, boy.

Oh.

Oh, well, that's not good.

Wow.

Can I help you?\
I'll be right back.

Right. Act out the name of the one\
Muffin wants and I'll guess it.

Ah, writing. Writing bird.

Book. Book Bird. Book Chicken.

Yes! No. Not Book Chicken.

Hand. Finger. Finger Chicken.\
Chicken Hands.

Is it Chicken Hands?

Oh, Madge, why can't you\
take better care of yourself?

Sorry, sir, we don't have\
any Moon Sprinklers.

I'm not actually sure they exist.

Forget the sprinklers,\
I've got a new problem.

Muffin wants a unicorn thing.

These kids know which one.

I need you to figure it out.

Why don't you just ask them?

Look, Alfie,\
you'll understand one day.

Can you help me?

Yes, I can help you.

Good man, Alfie. Alright, action.

See, that one's writing.

I think it's book, but I can't see\
any starting with book.

You're definitely writing\
something, but not a book.

It's not what you're writing.

It's what you're writing with.

Oh. Pen.

ALL: Yeah.

Good one, Alfie.

Now, what about you?

See, I thought it was a chicken,\
or some sort of pheasant,

maybe a partridge.

Is there a pen partridge?\
Shhh.

Oh, yeah, sorry.

You've got wings like a bird,\
but they're big wings.

Come on, Alfie.\
You have to be helpful.

Oh, you're squawking.

No, no, that's not squawking.

That's...

..breathing, fire.

Pen Dragon!

Yes!\
ALL: Yes!

Yes! We got it.

Bingo, you spoke.\
So did you.

Ah. I did.

Alfie, you rock star.

ALL: (CHANT) Alfie. Alfie. Alfie.

Hey, mate, are you his boss?\
Yes.

Well, he's a legend.

(ALL CHEER)

♪ Whoo-hoo,\
wrapping Muffin's present.

♪ Ooh. We need\
some more sticky tape.

♪ Oh, here's some more.\
♪ Thank you. ♪

I'm back.

ALL: (SING LIKE OPERA)\
♪ Our mother is back.

♪ How's Madge? ♪

Wow. It's loud in here.

SHOUTS: We like it loud.

Well, maybe just a little quieter\
for your poor Dad.

Ah, I'm fine.

It's music to my ears.

# "Mr Monkeyjocks" (Season 2 Episode 38)
Ooh, yeah, I want that one.\
And that one.

Ooh, I definitely want that one.

Kids, can you not leave\
all your stuff everywhere?

Ow! Biscuits.\
I'm bored.

How can you be bored\
when you've got this many toys?

Dad, can you buy me this TommyTeddy,\
this Starlight Unicorse

and this Rainbow Boobear?

No. You kids have got too many toys.

What? We've hardly got any.

Ahh!

I love you, Mama.\
That's it!

We've having a chuck-out.

This episode of Bluey\
is called "Mr Monkeyjocks".

OK, one basket for keeping\
and one basket for chucking.

No!

But we keep all the special toys\
and nothing's going in the bin.

It's all going to needy kids.

But WE'RE needy kids.

You're spoilt kids.\
No, we're not!

Wait, what does that mean?\
Focus, heelers.

Right, first customer.

Chuck.\
Arggh!

No, Snowy's special! Keep, keep!

Chuck.

Arggh!

Chutney Chimp's special.

The Bottle Fairy brought me him.

Not everything can be special.

That's not how that word works.

Ahh! Not Lady Sparklehound.

Oh, we're off to a great start.

OK, so, in the keep basket is...

..everything.

And in the chuck basket is\
a monkey wearing jocks.

Mr Monkeyjocks!\
We can't chuck Mr Monkeyjocks.

But you never play with him.\
We do!

He's special.

Well, you'd better show me\
he's special if you wanna keep him.

OK.

You'll probably regret that.

Doink!\
Hey!

Grr!

Breakfast! I'll just take my seat.

Hey! That monkey's in my chair!

It's his chair now.

Well, where am I supposed to sit?

Is there any more bacon?

Only for special people.

Not you, floor boy.

Floor boy?!

More maple syrup, Mr Monkeyjocks?

"Don't mind if I do."

Getting sick\
of this monkey.

Arggh! Ow!

Look out!

Turn! Turn! Red lights!

Has anyone seen my...sunnies?

OK, kids, this has gone a bit far.

You said we have to\
treat him special.

Chilli!

Oh, come here, lover boy.

Babe, can you please help... Huh?

How's my little monkey man?

Hey, mate, that's my wife.

Not anymore.

Mum married Mr Monkeyjocks.\
What?!

When did this happen?!

I was going to tell you.

You left me for a monkey?!

I'm sorry, honey. There's just\
something special about him.

Well, what am I supposed to do?

Ooh, what's that?

Oh, yes, good idea.

You can be his monkey butler.

What?!

Mmm, actually, I'd love to.

How may I be of service, sir?

Yes, sir. Right away.

You're probably gonna regret that.

Hey, what's going on?

Mr Monkeyjocks doesn't want\
bones on his bed.

He wants bananas.\
His bed?

That's not HIS bed.

It's MY bed.\
Not anymore.

This is his room now.

See ya!

Outrageous!

I'll just take the waist in.

Hey, that's Chutney Chimp's suit.

And Lady Sparklehound's hat.

Hey, he said he wanted 'em.

But you can't give him stuff\
just because he says he wants it.

Look, I'm just the butler.

If you have a problem,\
take it up with the monkey.

Oh, I will, alright.

Listen, mate, I think it's time\
for a certain someone

to find somewhere else to live.

I didn't mean us!

That was harsh, but fair, sir.

Aren't you being a little unfair,\
my sweet monkey man?

I thought you loved me!

That is one cheeky monkey.

How could he just kick us\
out of our own house?

It's very rude.

Well, it's kind of our fault.

We spoiled him.

What does "spoiled" mean?

It's a bit hard to explain.

Where are we gonna live?

Let's ask if we're allowed\
to sleep in the backyard, shall we?

And what about Pebbledasher?

Chuck? Yes, Master Monkeyjocks.

What's going on here?

Oh, thank goodness you're here.

You're chucking all our toys!\
I'M not.

He is. He's gone crazy.

He says he doesn't want any toys\
in this house that aren't him.

What?!

He says he's the only one\
who can be special.

Bluey, that's spoiled.

There you go, sir.\
All the toys have been chucked.

How does it feel, Mr Monkeyjocks?

He actually looks a bit bored.

How can he be bored?

He has everything he wants.

Can I listen to him?

Oh! He says he doesn't want\
everything he wants anymore.

Oh. Why ever not?

Because when you have\
everything you want...

Um, you listen, Mum.

Nothing feels special anymore.

Oh.

Hmm. What do you want to do?

Oh, you want a turn\
making someone else feel special?

Oh.

Ooh, sorry.

Let's try this again, kids.\
Snowspot.

Chuck.

Chutney Chimp. Chuck.

And Lady Sparklehound.

Chuck.

And Mr Monkeyjocks.

I hope you make\
someone feel special.

Now, don't get excited.

It's just a little something\
I found in the op shop.

Thanks, Mum.

It's a monkey!

Wearing jocks!\
I love him!

# "Double Babysitter" (Season 2 Episode 39)
(THEME MUSIC PLAYS)

(DOORBELL RINGS)

Uncle Rad's here.

Hi, Uncle... Hey, where is he?

Yarr.\
(SHRIEKS) Eee. Ha-ha-ha.

How you doing, Bluey?\
I'm Bingo.

Really?\
Yeah. That's Bluey.

Oh, yeah. 'Cause he's blue.

I'm a girl.\
Oh, yeah, yeah. I knew that.

Are you putting us to bed\
tonight, Uncle Rad?

You bet.\
Hooray!

Not hooray.

Bluey isn't sure about\
babysitter putdowns, Uncle Rad.

Don't worry, Bluey.

Who better to do a babysitter\
putdown than your Uncle Rad?

Hello.\
BINGO AND BLUEY: Frisky.

Hey, girls. Ooh.

This is Uncle Rad.

Hi.

Hi.

Frisky, have you met Bandit's\
brother, Radley, before?

Um, yeah.

Didn't you\
fall in the pool at the wedding?

Probably.

Frisky is Bluey's fairy godmother.

Sorry, Frisky, Uncle Rad\
got in touch last minute

and said he'd babysit.

You mustn't have got my message.

Oh, no. I didn't get it.\
That's fine.

Um, I'll just go.

No, not go. Both babysit.

Oh, well, as long\
as it's OK with Uncle Rad.

Fine by me.\
Hooray.

RAD: This episode of Bluey\
is called Double Babysitter.

ALL: Bye. Bye. Have fun.\
Have fun.

Bye.

Now, Bluey, tell me why you're not\
keen on babysitter putdowns.

Well, I had one before\
and I didn't like it.

Oh, why not?

It was just too different.

Well, your fairy godmother and I

will make this exactly\
the same as a Mum and Dad putdown.

But I don't know you\
as well as Mum and Dad.

Oh, yeah. Good point.

Well, you just need\
to get to know us better.

I know.\
Why don't we play 20 Questions?

Yeah.

Wait, what's 20 Questions?

Well, you ask us questions\
about ourselves and we answer them.

It's easy. Go.

Why don't you have a wife?\
Whoa.

Well, how do you know I don't?

Do you have a wife?\
Well, no.

So why don't you have a wife?

Ahh, her turn.

How many friends have you got?

Oh, um...three?

That's not many.\
Why have you only got three friends?

Well, um...back to him.

Why do we only see you at Christmas?

'Cause I work on an oil rig.

Is that why you don't have a wife?

Oh, maybe.

What's an oil rig?

Why is your hair so pretty?

BOTH: Almond milk shampoo.

Do you want to have children?

BOTH: Yes.

Will Bosco be the Daddy?

Um, no.

Bosco and I aren't friends anymore.

Who's Bosco?\
No-one. Next question.

Bosco's her true love.

Not anymore.\
But true love is forever.

Well, ah...

Is true not forever?

It is. I mean, I thought it was.

Ah, let's play in the backyard.\
BINGO AND BLUEY: Yeah.

Can you play the exact same games\
as Mum and Dad?

OK, what do they play?

Chickenrat.\
Chickenwhat?

Come Here and Go Away.\
Come and go where now?

You don't need\
the same games, Bluey.

You need Torchmouse.

Squeak. Squeak, squeak, squeak.

Meow. Meow. Meow. Meow. Meow?

Arghh.\
Squeak, squeak, squeak.

Squeak, squeak, squeak.

Nibble, nibble. Nibble, nibble.

Meow.

Meow.

Meow?

Meow?\
Squeak.

Meow?\
Rarr.

Rowrr. Rowrr.\
Squeak.

Torchmouse was fun,

but I don't want to do anything else\
that's different, please.

What about this?\
Whee. This is weird.

Yeah. But before you know it,\
you get used to it.

(SHRIEKS AND GIGGLES)

Do me.\
Oh, boy. I'll give it a crack.

(GRUNTS)

Hello, upside down Bingo.\
Hi.

Bingo. You've gotten...heavy.

Come and sit by the camp fire.

I'm trying. Ooh.

How about a story?

And then the prince knocked the\
dragon out with a big prince punch.

Boom.\
BINGO AND BLUEY: Hooray.

Princess. I have rescued you.

Now we shall marry.

And the Princess replied,\
"No thanks."

What?

She didn't like the look of him.\
Why not?

Well, his hair was a bit messy,\
and he was a bit too muscly,

you know what I mean, kids?

(BOTH GIGGLE)

Hang on, I prince-punch the dragon,

take you back to my castle\
and we get married.

That's business.

Hey, I didn't ask to be rescued.

You'd rather stay here\
with the stinky dragon?

I'm getting used to him.

(BOTH GIGGLE)

OK, I'll wake him up.

Wait. No.\
Yeah. Didn't think so.

Ugh, "Princes are all the same,"\
she thought.

No we're not. There's good princes\
and bad princes, m'lady.

Everyone knows that.

Which one was this prince?

He's good. He rescued the princess.

Only because he likes\
prince-punching dragons.

Tomorrow he'll be off\
in search of another princess.

Man, this princess\
is hard to rescue.

(BOTH GIGGLE)

Well, while the prince figures\
it all out, she grabs a nice book

and lives happily ever after.

The end.

What?\
That is not the end.

In Mum and Dad stories,\
they get married in the end.

Er, princess?\
OK, fine.

For the sake of the children,\
they get married. The end.

BOTH: Hooray.\
I'll take it.

Night-night, Bingo.\
Did you have a good...

(SNORES)

Frisky, you won't watch TV\
after I fall asleep, will you?

Oh, ah, no, we don't have to.

You promise?

Oh, hang on.

Was your last babysitter putdown\
with Nana?

Yes.

And let me guess, you woke up\
and the TV was too loud.

Yes.

Mum can't hear very well\
so she turns it up loud.

She was watching something scary.

That's why you don't\
like babysitter putdowns, isn't it?

Yes.

Look, you just had a bad one, kid.

This one will be different.\
We promise.

But how can I know for sure\
it won't happen again?

You can't.

But you have to give it a go anyway,

or you'll be stuck in a tower\
with a stinky dragon forever.

OK, I'll give it a go.

That's my girl.

(IN THE DISTANCE) Absolutely.

Yeah, that's right.

No, I never thought of it that way.

It's the only shampoo I like.

The shampoo is great,

but the conditioner,\
I don't rate the conditioner.

Nah, me neither.

But you know, you can't get around\
with open follicles.

I'm going to eat you.

Bingo!\
Arggh!

I didn't say\
you could have a biscuit.

Put it back.\
Sorry. (GIGGLES)

You're being a bit\
of a cheeky kid today.

I'm not a cheeky kid.

I know. You're a good kid.

But you just called me "cheeky".

No, I said you're BEING cheeky.

There's a difference.

(SADLY) No, there isn't.

Oh, Bingo.

Humph.

I'm in a bad mood.

Nothing's going to cheer me up.

Nothing at all.

(GASPS)

Are these still dirty?

Dad!\
Oh, hi, Bingo.

Oh, no, not bad mood.

(GIGGLES)

BLUEY: This episode of Bluey\

Hey, Bingo, check out my...\
Ohh!

Bingo, what are you doing?

(LAUGHS) I can't help it.

Ooh!\

Oh, hi, Bingo.

Arggh!\
Ahh!

Ugh!\
Ahh!

(GIGGLES)\
Bingo, what's gotten into you?

(LAUGHS) It's not me.

Mum, Bingo knocked down my tower.

Ahhh!\
Dad's stinky jocks!

This isn't like you, Bingo.

It's not my fault. (LAUGHS)

Wait. I know what's going on.

What?\
Bingo's in a bad mood.

Oh, yeah. Well, we have to\
help her get out of it.

How do we do that?

I'm not sure, but you have\
to think of something, Bluey.

She's tearing the place apart.\
Arggh!

OK, let's do this, Bingo.

Bingo?

(GIGGLES)

Arggh, Bingo!

Mum didn't say you could watch TV.

It's not me, it's my bad mood.

(LAUGHS) I don't even like cricket.

I'll take that.\
Arggh!

(GIGGLES)

Hey, Bingo, come back.

Ooh.

Bingo, you're eating treat food!

Hee-hee. It's not me.

My bad mood is making me\
eat chocolate.

Stop it. You'll get a tummy ache.

Rarr!\
(GIGGLES)

Uhh, uhh, uhh.

Oh.

Come on, Bluey, think.

What gets me out of a bad mood?

Ooh, I know.

Uhh, uhh, uhh...\
Ah!

Yoo-hoo, bad mood Bingo?

Fancy a little sit\
in your relaxer chair?

Ooh! Uhh, uhh, uhh, uhh...\
(GIGGLES)

Now, how about we close our eyes

and take some\
relaxing belly breaths?

Deep breath in... (BREATHES IN)\
..all the way to your belly.

Stop fidgeting, honey.

And out.

Isn't that relaxing?

(CREAKING)\
(GIGGLES)

Best not to creak the door, honey.

(LAUGHS)\
Sweetheart...

Rarr!\
(LAUGHS)

Well, that didn't work.

Uhh, uhh, uhh...

Hey, Bingo, maybe you'd like\
to draw some lovely pictures?

That always helps me\
when I'm in a bad mood.

Look at this happy unicorn.

Perhaps you'd like to add\
something lovely to it.

Ugh! Uhh, uhh, uhh...\
(GIGGLES)

Oh, goodness.

Well, that's lovely.

Arr! Uhh!\
Oh!

I'm sorry, Bluey.\
(LAUGHS)

Uhh, uhh, uhh, uhh, uhh...\
(GIGGLES)

Oh, Bingo?\
(UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYS)

What's this? Your favourite song?

Doesn't it make you want to dance?

Uhh. (STOPS MUSIC)\
Hey!

(UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYS)\
Dance with me, Bingo.

You love this song.\
(GIGGLES)

I want to dance,\
but something's stopping me.

No-one can stay in a bad mood\
while this song is on.

Rarr-rarr.

Maybe it just needs to be louder!\
(VOLUME INCREASES)

(LAUGHS)\
Arggh! Arggh!

ARGGH!\
Bingo, you're free!

Run!

Hee-hee, quick, we have to get away\
before your bad mood comes back.

Let's hide in here, Bingo.

Bingo?

Uhh, uhh, uhh, uhh.

(GIGGLES)

Bingo? Bingo?

Where are you?

(GIGGLES)\
What?!

Bingo, you're back in your bad mood.\
Yeah!

But I got you out of it.\
Why did you get back in?

Um...\
Uhh! Uhh!

Boogers!

Mum, I got Bingo out\
of her bad mood.

Well done.

But she just went back in it.\
What?

Then she chased me with her boogers.

Oh, I've seen this before.

She must like being in a bad mood.

Why would anyone like\
being in a bad mood?

I don't know.

Uhh, uhh, uhh!\
(GIGGLES)

So, what are we meant to do?

Ooh, that's tricky. Um...

Ooh, I've got an idea.

Uhh!\
(GIGGLES)

Oh, wow, this is the best house\
I've ever made.

Oh, I'm so happy with it.

I hope it lasts forever.

Arggh!\
(GIGGLES)

Ooh!\
No, bad mood.

Oh, I might just wander\
over here now.

Arggh. Arr, uhh!\
(GIGGLES)

Huh?

If you wanna squash my house,\
you gotta catch it first!

Rarrgh!

(LAUGHS)\
(GIGGLES)

(BREATHES HEAVILY)

Ugh!

Aha, bad moods hate running around.

Arggh... Ahh...

Ahh...

Come on, Bingo.

No, I wanna stay in my bad mood.

(ALL GRUNT WITH EXERTION)

Mum, I got her out!

Give her here.\
Huh?

What do you reckon, Bingo?

Now you're in a GOOD mood.

Cuddle.\
Aw.

(GIGGLES)

Cuddle.\
(GIGGLES)

Cuddle.\
(GIGGLES)

Cuddle.\
(GIGGLES)

Maybe I should give\
my bad mood a cuddle.

Oooh...

No way. He's bad.

No, he isn't.

He was just behaving bad.

Mmm.\

# "Octopus" (Season 2 Episode 41)
(THEME MUSIC)

You're going to love this game,\
Chloe.

How do you play it?

Dad, can you explain it?

(BURBLES)\
(BOTH LAUGH)

OK. I'll explain it.

Dad's the octopus.\
That's why he talks like that.

(BURBLES)

And we're fish or something,

and we have to steal his treasure

and get back to our fish home.

Ah, is that all the rules, Dad?

(BURBLES)\
(BOTH LAUGH)

This episode of Bluey\
is called Octopus.

Come on, Chloe!\
Eee! How are we going to get past?

Don't worry.\
Octopuses aren't very smart. Watch.

Look! A robin!\
(BURBLES)

Come on! (SQUEALS)

(BURBLES)

Chloe! Help!\
What do I do?

Do that knee thing you do.\
OK.

Oop! Oop!

(BURBLES)

Ah! I'm free!

BOTH: Hooray!

(BURBLES)\
(BOTH LAUGH)

Now we have to get back!

Let me try.

Look!\
(BURBLES)

A cockatoo!

(BOTH SQUEAL)\
(BURBLES)

BOTH: Hooray!

I told you they're not very smart.

(DOORBELL RINGS)\
My dad's here.

See you, Bluey.\
Bye, Chloe!

Mmm-hmm-hmm.\
(BURBLES)

(LAUGHS)

Dad, can you play Octopuses with me\
when we get home?

It's so much fun.

Um, yes, OK. That sounds like a good\
way to learn about sea creatures.

There. Now you have to be\
an octopus.

Um, OK. (CLEARS THROAT)

Hi. I'm an octopus.

Octopuses don't talk like that.

Well, octopi don't talk at all.

Yeah, they do.\
They go... (BURBLES)

Blub, blub?

Yeah, like that, but more.

Blub, blub, blub, blub?

And you have to wave\
your arms about.

They're actually called tentacles.

OK, you have to wave\
your tentacles about.

Blub, blub... (SIGHS)\
Look, this all feels a bit silly.

I think I'm just going to be\
a quiet octopus.

OK. This is your treasure.

I don't think an octopus\
would have treasure.

That's more of a pirate thing.

But he has to.\
And I have to steal it.

Ready?\
Ah, I guess.

Look, a robin!

Why would a robin be under the sea?

Dad! You're not meant to be smart.

You're an octopus.

OK, got it.

(SQUEALS, LAUGHS)

Let me try again.

Ah!\
Got you again.

Ah, Dad, you're making it too hard.

OK, OK. Go again. I'll make it easy.

Dad, now it's too easy.

Oh! My knees.

Let's try swapping.

(BURBLES)

(LAUGHS)\
OK, here we go.

(HUMS)

Got it.

No, Dad, you have to go along\
this bit.

But this is the safer route.

Dad!\
OK, OK, I'll go this way.

And...go!

(BURBLES)

I win.\
(SIGHS)

What's up, Chloe? Is the game over?

Yes.

You're not playing it properly.

But this is how I play it.

Hmm.

Bluey's dad is more fun than you.

Oh. I see.

(SAD MUSIC)

Hi, Dad.\
Hey, Chloe.

What are you reading?

Oh, I'm reading facts about octopi.

Oh! How come?

Well, I thought maybe it will help\
me play your octopus game better.

Oh.

Turns out octopi are actually\
quite smart.

Really?\
And you WERE right.

They do collect treasure. See?

They collect objects\
to make their houses strong.

Ooh. Wow.

So I'm sorry I said you were wrong.

Well, I'm sorry I said\
Bluey's dad is more fun than you.

That's OK. He probably is.

But you're fun, too. Really.

It's just that every time\
I do something, you say,

"No, but octopuses don't do that."

Do I?\
Yes.

Well, that's funny because I feel\
like every time I say something,

you say, "No, octopuses\
don't do that."

Oh. Well, how about this rule?

No-one is allowed to say,\
"No, but octopuses don't do that."

OK. What should we say instead?

How about we can say,\
"Yes! This octopus does that"?

Yeah, but in octopus,\
that sounds a bit like this.

(BURBLES)\
(LAUGHS)

Yeah!\
(LAUGHS)

Is there any more things\
about octopuses?

Well, yeah, look.

When an octopus is scared\
and wants to escape,

it can shoot at a cloud of ink.

Wow! Ooh, what's that?

An electric eel. It's an eel that\
can make its own electricity.

Wow!

Animals don't like being hurt,

so they do all sorts of things\
to avoid it.

Oh. What else is there?

Well, see this? It's a flying fish.

A fish that can fly?!

Yeah, just small distances,\
but still.

That's clever.

(KNOCKS ON DOOR)

Hey, Bluey.\
Hey, Chloe.

Do you want to play octopus with us?\
Ooh, OK.

(BURBLES)

OK. This time we're eels.

Got it! I'll be\
a south mariba octopus.

Oh, no! That's a poisonous one.

You have to freeze for four seconds\
if he touches you.

Ooh, OK.\
Let's go!

(BURBLES)\
(SQUEALS)

Bluey! He got you!

One, two, three...\
Don't worry.

I'm an electric eel. Zzz!\
(BURBLES)

Oh, wow!\
Ha-ha!

Got your treasure!

(BURBLES)\
(BOTH LAUGH)

How will we get back?

Watch this!

Look! A flying fish!

(BOTH LAUGH)\
(BURBLES)

Ahh!\
He squirted ink on you!

He did what?!

Octopi can squirt ink out.

I didn't know that!

Don't worry! I'll save you!

Zzzz!\
(SQUEALS, LAUGHS)

I made it!\
Ahh! He's got me!

Bluey! Help!

What do I do?

Turn into flat-backed sea turtle!

A what?

Grab the cushion!\
OK!

Here comes the turtle!

Pull me, turtle, pull me!

(GROANS)

Ha-ha! Let's go!

(BOTH SQUEAL)\
(BURBLES)

BOTH: Yay!\
We won!

That was so fun!\
Yeah, it was, wasn't it?

Can I be the octopus?\
Yeah.

Can the octopus be poisonous\
AND electric?

BOTH: Yeah. This octopus can.

# "Bin Night" (Season 2 Episode 42)
Hi, bins!

Hey, those dogs are back.

Ooh, they've got food.\
Gimme, gimme.

Om nom nom nom!

Great curry. Oh, that's good.

Nom nom nom. Burnt rice.

That's not so good.

Oh, wait, are these... Yeah.

Spring rolls! Om nom nom!

Hey, man. What about me?

Just cardboard tonight, yellow bin.

That's cool, man.\
I love cardboard.

Hey, how was kindie, Bingo?

Good. There's a new kid.

His name's Banjo.

Oh, way to go. What's he like?

I don't know.

Hi, Doreen.\
Hi!

Oh, your bin's full.

Mr Crow will be coming tomorrow.

Yeah, Mr Crow!

Night, girls.

Night, bins!\
Night, bin.

This episode of Bluey\
is called Bin Night.

Good one, Bluey!

Hey, Bingo,

why don't you try and play\
with Banjo today?

Why?

Well,\
it can be hard being the new kid.

He might like having someone\
to play with.

OK, Mumma.

Bin man's here!

Whoa!

There it goes.

Hooray! Thanks, bin man!

Come on. Let's get to school.

Can I be a bin lady when I grow up?

If you like.

Hooray!

Hi, moon.

Frosty breath.

Yellow bin, where are you?

It's not yellow bin's turn, red bin.

I miss you, yellow bin.

It's OK, red bin.

I think they're sisters.

Hey, how was kindie, Bingo?

Good.

Wait, no. Bad.

Oh, why bad?

Banjo called me a Bobo head.

What's a Bobo head?\
I don't know.

Did he call anyone else a Bobo head?

Yeah,\
he called everyone a Bobo head.

Oh, OK.

Well, still, not nice, Banjo.

Ooh, bin's full this week, girls.

We had a barbie!

Mr Crow will definitely\
be coming tomorrow.

I'll be ready!

Good one, Bluey.

Hey, Bingo, if someone at kindie\
calls you a name,

just tell Mrs Retriever, OK?

OK, Mumma.

Mum, can I be a scarecrow\
when I grow up?

If you like.\
Hooray!

Thanks, bin man!

OK, team.

Let's get to school.

How was kindie, Bingo?

Good. And bad.

Banjo called me a Bobo head.

Again?

What did you do?

I told Mrs Retriever.

And what did she say?

She said, "Well, Bingo,\
are you a Bobo head?"

And I said, "No,"\
and she said, "Well, there you go."

So I played in the sandpit\
with Felix.

Nice work, Bingo.

Oh, there's not much rubbish today.\
Yeah.

Why you no feed me properly?

Oh, come here.

Oh, far out, Doreen.

Kids, go and give her a hand.\
OK!

Thanks, girls.

I had the ladies\
from mahjong around.

Don't worry.\
I'll keep your bin safe.

Thanks, Bluey.

Well done, Bluey!

How was kindie, Bingo?

Good. Banjo called me a Bobo head.

Oh, what did you do?

I said, "Banjo,\
I'm not a Bobo head."

What did Banjo do?

He ran off and threw his hat in the\
bubbler, so I played in the sandpit.

Oh, well done, Bingo.

Hey, what's with all the salad?

Sorry, red bin.\
That's OK.

Dad, are there aliens on the moon?

Yeah, maybe.\
Ooh.

Mum, can I be an astronaut\
when I grow up?

If you like.

Hooray!

Thanks, bin man!

Ah! It's too wet!

Hi, Doreen's bin.

Hi, Bluey and Bingo's bin.

Oh, you look full.

Yeah, these guys eat a lot.

Hey, Bingo, are you OK?

Banjo said my arms are too stubby\
to reach the monkey bars.

Oh, man, this Banjo.

He said they're too stubby\
for me to be four.

He said I must still be two.

But I'm not two. I'm four.

And what did you say?

I said, "I'm not stubby"\
and then Felix said, yes, I am.

Oh, come here, mate.

Thanks for telling me, kid.

It's good to get that stuff out,\
isn't it?

You know, Bingo, when I was your age\
I was a bit stubby.

Really?\
Yeah.

We're heelers. We're a bit stubby.

But we're tough.\
Oh.

Ahhh!

Hi, moon.

How was kindie, Bingo?\
Good!

I can hang on the monkey bars\
longer than anyone else.

Oh, way to go.

And how's Banjo?

Good. And bad.

He called Felix a Bobo head.

Well,\
I hope Felix told Mrs Retriever.

No.\
He threw Banjo's hat in the bubbler.

Oh.

It made Banjo cry,\
so I played with him in the sandpit.

We're friends now.

Oh, good one, Bingo.

Hey, yellow bin, you sure you\
meant to be here tonight?

Oh, good question.

Hey, Doreen,\
is it both bins tonight?

Don't ask me. I just copy you.

No, it's only red bin tonight.

You sure?\
Yeah.

It's only both bins\
when the moon is a big moon,

or a half-moon or a no moon.

And tonight's not any of them.

Look, it's a smiley moon.

That's my favourite.

Oh, you clever little dog.

Oh, Bluey, I think you'll be\
a scientist when you grow up.

Oh, can I?

If you like.\
Great!

Maybe I can invent a robot\
that takes the bins out for you.

Oh, I hope not.

# "Muffin Cone" (Season 2 Episode 43)
Almost at Bluey and Bingo's, Muffles.

Hooray!

Ah, ah, Muffin!

Don't suck your thumb.\
Why?

'Cause it's not good for your teeth,\
hon.

I want to do what I want!\
It's my thumb.

OK, well, you know what I have to do.

Muffin's here.

Now we can play sandwich shop.

Hey, Muf... Whoa!\
Whoa!

What is that?

It's a cone!

This episode of Bluey\
is called Muffin Cone.

Oh, poor Muffin.

Why is Muffin wearing a cone?

It's to make her stop\
sucking her thumb.

Grr! Eh! Ehhh!

Get in my...

Trix, are you sure about this?

Well, she needs to break the habit.

I guess.

Look, if she promises to stop sucking\
her thumb, I can take it off.

What do you think, Muffin?

I want to suck my thumb!

This is gonna make it hard\
to play sandwich shop.

Ah!

Up you get, Muffin.

Can I be the sandwich shop lady?

Um, sure.

Let's give that a go.

Hi!\
Hello.

What would you like\
on your sandwich?

Um, ham and tomato, please.

OK. Coming right up.

Here's the bread.

No, that's cheese.

And that's lettuce!

It's bread! I can feel it.

You can't see anything\
with your cone on.

Please can you promise\
not to suck your thumb?

No! I can see.

Here. I'll help you.

Here's the bread.

Thank you. Here's the ham.

Holly!\
Now I'll cut it into triangles.

Where's the knife?

Muffin,\
you're making a baby sandwich.

Here's the knife.\
That's not a knife.

This knife doesn't cut.

Ah!

Oh, this isn't a knife.

Let's go and see Aunt Trixie.

It's a bit of tough love,\
that's all.

All she needs to do is\
not put her thumb in her mouth.

It's easy.\
Chips?

Nah, I'm off the chips.

Trying to eat healthy.\
Good on you.

Well, one won't hurt.

Aunt Trixie, can you please\
take Muffin's cone off?

Well, if I take it off the first\
thing she'll do is suck her thumb.

She won't!

She promises. Don't you, Muffin?

See?

Please, Aunt Trixie.

Yeah, please, Aunt Trixie.

OK.\
Hooray!

Thank you, Aunt Trixie.

We promise Muffin won't\
suck her thumb even once.

Muffin!

Why can't you just\
not suck your thumb?

I don't know.

I just can't.

Well, we can't play sandwich shop,\
then.

I'm sorry.

I mean, she is only three.

There's nothing wrong with a\
three year old sucking their thumb,

I guess.

Oh, get these things away from me.

Sorry.\
I shouldn't have put them out.

You're trying to be healthy.\
Nah, it's fine.

Are you sure?\
Yeah, I can resist.

Oh.

I'm gonna have a chat\
with Bluey and Bingo.

I'll be right back.

Egg and lettuce, please.\
OK.

Hey, Bluey, is Muffin OK?

No, she's upset\
because she has to wear her cone.

Which means she can't play\
sandwich shop properly.

Well, is there a game\
she can play with her cone?

Maybe,\
but we want to play sandwich shop.

Alright.

It's just, I think she's feeling\
a little embarrassed about her cone.

Well, why can't\
she just not suck her thumb?

She will one day.

Just don't give up on her, OK?

Hi, Muffin.

I'm sorry I can't stop\
sucking my thumb.

It's OK, Muffin.

I think I have to\
wear my cone forever.

Well, then, we're going to\
think of game where your cone is OK.

Really?\
Yeah.

Thanks, Bluey.

What if we pop it down?

Ooh, yeah.

Aunt Trixie didn't say\
anything about that.

Ooh, OK.

Yeah!

You look like a wedding wife.\
Or a traffic cone.

Or a ballerina.

I know. Let's play wedding wife,\
traffic cone and ballerina.

Yeah!\
Yeah!

Sorry, Trix, I...

What happened to the chips?

Trix!

It might be time to\
take off Muffin's cone.

♪ We're getting married,\
we're getting married

♪ We're getting married! ♪

Please go around the traffic cone!

I said,\
please go around the traffic cone!

Oh, husband, thank you so much\
for taking me to the ballet show.

No worries, babe.

Wonderful!

Unreal, babe.

Bluey, the seed is hatching!

Muffin, honey,\
you can take off your cone n...

Hooray!

Thank you for hatching,\
beautiful sunflower.

We love you.

Bye, Bingo. Bye, Bluey.\
Bye, Chilli. See you, kids.

See you next Thursday!

Almost at Bluey and Bingo's, Muffy.\
Hooray!

Hey, Dad, look at me!

Hey!

Muffin's here!

Cone of shame!

Monkey. Oh, lion.

Your turn.

CHILLI: Kids! Can you come here,\
please?

Oh, do we have to?\
Yes, come on!

But why do we have to?

We're deciding what cake to make\
for Bingo's birthday!

Rocket ship?\
No, thanks.

No, thanks.

Sewing machine?\
Nah. Keep going.

Ooh, what about swimming pool?

No, thanks.

Whoa, jet planes.\
Nah. Keep turning.

(GASPS) Duck cake!\
Yeah, duck cake!

Oh, Bingo, are you sure?

That looks hard to make.\
Yeah, I'm sure.

Why do you want a duck cake?

'Cause it made my tail wag.

Can't argue with that.\
Duck cake it is.

Good luck.\
What?! I have to make it?

I have to take Bingo to mini hockey.

Ooh, look, my tail\
loves mini hockey too.

Plus you remember my clown cake?

(ALL SHUDDER)\
I remember.

He was not a funny clown.

Alright, I'll give it a crack.\
PUPS: Duck cake!

This episode of Bluey\
is called Duck Cake.

Make sure it looks\
exactly like the picture.

(SQUEALS)\
I'll do my best.

Don't worry, Dad, I can help you.

You can help by\
clearing this mess up.

Oh, why do I have to?\
I only did the zoo hospital.

Bingo did the motel.

OK, you clean up your half, Bingo\
will do hers when she gets back.

See you soon!

Mum, how do animals with no tails\
know when they're happy?

Good question, Bingo.

OK, let's do this. Whoa! Oh!

(GIGGLES)

OK, just cut these pointy bits.

Hey, Dad, can I help you now?

Did you clean up the zoo hospital?\
No. I wanna help with the cake.

You can't just help with\
the fun stuff, kid.

Oh! But the fun stuff's more fun.

What if I give you\
stickers to tidy up?

That might make it more fun.\
Ooh, stickers.

OK, penguins, giraffes,\
monkey house.

I'll give you one\
gold sticker for each.

Ooh, OK. But I'm not doing Bingo's.

Yeah, yeah, I know, just your side.

Oh, that was easy.\
(GROANS) Duck cake.

Dad!

I cleaned up the monkey house!\
Can I have a star now?

Oh, yeah, OK. Here you go.\
Thanks.

Keep going.\
Ooh, shiny.

OK, Bandit, time to cut the head.

Come on, do... Oh!

Oh, duck heads\
don't have to be round.

(HUMS)\
You finished yet?

Yep.

This is not finished.

You asked if I was finished,\
and I am.

But you don't get\
the rest of your stars

until you've done the whole thing.

Ooh, I decided I only want this one.

Look how lovely it is.

Plus it has icing on it.

Bluey, come on, tidy the rest.

But why do I have to?\
'Cause it's your mess.

If you don't tidy it, then who will?

Uh, you?\
Me?

Oh, right, OK, yeah, I'll do it.

Even though I have to make\
a duck cake for your sister -

the hardest of all cakes -\
I'll just tidy up your mess instead.

I'm about to start.

Are you sure this is what you want?\
Oh, yeah.

(GROWLS) Look, I'll give you two\
dollar bucks to clean the whole zoo.

(GASPS) Really?

Whoo! I can buy a star pony.\
Uh!

Not till you've done the whole lot.

But not Bingo's half.\
No, not Bingo's half.

(GIGGLES)

(MIXER WHIRRS)\
Uh!

Oh, hang on, you're meant to\
do icing at the end.

Eh, it's all good.

Dad.\
Have you finished?

Not yet. I just want to know,

how many star ponies can\
I get for two dollar bucks?

Star ponies cost $50, kid.

So how many can I get?

None, mate.\
Oh!

If I clean up my zoo, will you\
give me enough for a star pony?

I'm not paying you 50 bucks\
to clean up your mess, Bluey.

Oh, why not?

Because I shouldn't be paying you\
anything. You should just do it.

But why should I do it?\
'Cause you just should.

But why should I just should?

Oh, 'cause I'll let you\
lick the beater.

(SCREECHES)

Finished!

OK, here you go.

(LAUGHS) At last you are mine.

OK, moment of truth, Bandit.

Attaching of the head.

Now I know why you should do jobs.\
Why is that?

Icing.

I believe in you, mate.\
You can do this.

It's good. It's very good.

Oh, too easy! OOH, duck cake!

Oh, that's not good.

Are you OK, Dad?

Yeah, mate, I'm OK.

Don't worry.

Dad...\
Yeah, mate?

Maybe we can make the duck's\
neck into a sorta head.

Oh, OK.

Let's give it a go.

I'll just clean up the...\
Hey, what?

Did you clean this up?\
Oh, um, yeah.

Thanks, Bluey.

Ooh!

OK, let's give this another go.

Uh, you go ahead.\
I just wanna try something.

BOTH: Finished.

We're back! Bingo, take your\
hockey boots off outside, please.

OK.\
Wow, Bluey!

Did you tidy all this?\
Oh, uh, yeah.

Bingo's half as well?\
Uh-huh.

Thanks, Bluey.

Duck cake!

Sorry.

Don't worry, honey,\
you don't have to clean that up.

Hee-hee! OK, Mum.

Uh, here's your duck cake,\

# "Road Trip" (Season 2 Episode 46)
Come on, kids. Let's motor.

Why do we always have to motor?

So we can get a good spot\
at the campsite.

How long will it take to get there?

A long time.\
What if I get bored?

Then you get bored.

Hey, you haven't packed\
the kids' stuff yet.

Ah, I was just gonna bung it\
down by their feet.

Are you sure?

What's this?\
The kids' stuff.

Oh, biscuits!

This episode of Bluey\
is called Road Trip.

OK, we're a bit later than I hoped,\
but we're still making good time.

Bingo, keep your eye out\
for grey nomads.

Grey what?\
Dad?

No, we're not there yet.

Oh, but I'm bored.

You're born? I know you're born.

I was there when it happened.\
Dad!

It was a real eye-opener.\
Mum!

Look, because I'm such a champion,

I brought the tablets so you kids\
could play computer games.

BOTH: Hooray, computer games!

Hang on, where are they?

Ahh! They must be in the boot.

Bandit, find a place to pull over.\
What?!

I know I packed them.

(HORN HONKS RHYTHMICALLY)

What is that?

Oh, no. We've gotta go.

But what about the tablets?\
Forget it.

What? Why?!

Grey nomads!

Come on!\
OK, OK.

Whoo-hoo.

Phew! that was too close.

What are grey nomads?

They're nannas and grandads\
in big, slow caravans.

If we get stuck behind them,\
we'll be the last to the campsite

and we'll have to camp\
next to the toilet block.

BOTH: Eww.

I like the grey nomads.\
Their horns are funny.

But what about the tablets?

Look, Mum forgot to pack 'em, kids.\
Oh!

Aww!\
Don't worry.

I know plenty of non-computer games\
we can play.

Hope you've got four hours' worth.

Games like what?

Games like...I Spy.

Yeah! Me first!

OK, but please spy\
a hard one, Bingo.

It's boring when it's too easy.\
OK.

I spy with my little eye\
something coloured...

..blue.\
Me?

Yes.

(GROANS) Please can I play\
computer games?

What's so fun about them?

Well, there's one where you have to\
make Chunky Chimp jump over barrels.

You don't need computers\
to play jumping games.

Just use your fingers. Whoop! Whoop!

Boing, boing!

Boing...

But there's no barrels to jump.

Uh, yeah, but you can jump...

..cows!\
(COW MOOS)

Oh, yeah!

Boing! One point!

Boing!\
Two points!

BANDIT: Whoop! Three points.

Hey, you can't play. You're driving.

Oh, yeah.\

There's nothing boring\

No.

Biscuits!

Time to go! Come on!\
What?!

We're going now.\
What's going on?

It's not finished!

BINGO: Bye, grey nomads.

Don't worry, gang.\
We're still making good time.

Ooh! Big Peanut.

Mum, have you got another car game?

Look, I'm a bit out of...\
(TRAIN HORN BLARES)

(GASPS) Wait, train race!

Go Dad!\
You got it!

Rrrrrr!\
Faster!

Beat it.\
We're winning!

Yeah.

Oh, now, the train's winning.

Fast! Go, go!\
I'm trying!

Oh, it's too fast!

That was fun.

Oh, hang on. What's this?

Oh, roadworks!

I need the toilet.\
OK, come on.

I'll take you for a bush wee.\
Don't be long.

We'll be as long as we need,\
thank you.

Mum, do you know any bush wee games?

Oh! I'll all out of games,\
sweetheart.

Oh, but I'm bored.

Look, Bluey, sometimes,\
you're just gonna be bored.

But what do I do about it?

You just be bored.\
You know, look around.

Something always pops up. (BLOWS)

(HORN HONKS RHYTHMICALLY)\
Oh, crumbed steak!

Grey nomads!

BANDIT: Back in the car! Come on!

Chill the beans.

It's OK. They're still behind us.

The guy hasn't turned the sign yet.

He's turning it.\
Oh, sweet, let's go!

I need a wee.\
OK. Come on, honey.

Hang on. What? No!

(GENTLE MUSIC)

Hello, grey nomads.

Finished.

(GROANS)\
I like the grey nomads' stickers.

(SIGHS) Bored again!

Hmm, never seen that before.

(GASPS) Bingo, a table!

Has it been here all along?

Mum, look what I found!

Ah, the tablets!

Huh? Tablets?

Oh, wow.

Do you wanna play computer games?

Uh, no, I wanna play Petrol Station.

Yeah, I'll be the customer.

Hello, customer.\
Would you like to buy some sunnies?

I told you I packed 'em.

Now's not a good time for me.

Oh, poor Bandit.

We were making such good time.

Yeah, but look.

OK, well, that's\
100 dollar bucks, please.

OK.\
OK.

Now we're making good TIMES.

There you go.

Hey, wait, they're turning off!

They're turning off!\
Where are they going?

They're going to the Big Peanut.

The what?!

The Big Peanut.

Why aren't WE\
going to the Big Peanut?

Well, um, it's just...

We're almost in the clear.

But it's a big peanut!

I know, but...

(SIGHS) OK.

Let's go to the Big Peanut.\
BINGO AND BLUEY: Hooray!

Peanut, Peanut, Peanut, Peanut!

CHILLI: You're a good dog,\
Bandit Heeler.

BINGO AND BLUEY: Wow.

It's a pretty big peanut, isn't it?

Yes, grey nomads, it is.

Would you like a Big Peanut sticker?

I've got a spare one.\
Ooh, yes, please.

Oh, Bingo.\
You can start a collection.

Ooh, dinosaur.

Its mouth opens and shuts.

Arggh!

Dad, can I have one of these?

Only if you pay for it yourself.

But I haven't got any money.\
Well, then you can't have it.

But I want it.

Well, that's commonly called\
bad luck.

Oh, that's not fair.\
It's pretty fair.

Whaaaa!

Get it off! Get it off!\
Oh!

Ice-cream!

Hi, kids.

Dad, ice-cream!

Keep walking.\
Oh, can't we have an ice-cream?

Nope. No-one's having ice-cream.

Why not?

Because you had one yesterday, kid.\
It's too much sugar.

Ohhhh!

Oh, no fair.

It's fairly fair.

Well, why does Muffin\
get an ice-cream?

Muffin's not getting an ice-cream.

I got an ice-cream!\
See?

Oh, thanks, mate.

Look, kids, Muffin gets an ice-cream

'cause she got a dinosaur\
stuck on her head.

It was a velociwaptor.

Oh, no fair.

It's totally fair.

Maybe Muffin'll give you\
a lick of hers.

Yeah, that's not gonna happen, mate.

Can I have a lick, please, Muffin?

Grrr!

Dad!

Oh, OK, OK.

You can have an ice-cream.

Yay! Ice-cream!

This episode of Bluey\
is called Ice Cream.

Look, they've got mango.

This is the happiest day ever\
of my life.

Oh, our ferry's here, Muffin.

See you later, girls.

Bye, Bluey. Bye, Bingo.

Hey, kids, Uncle Stripe and Muffin\
are saying goodbye.

Oh, bye, Muffin.\
Bye, Uncle Strawberry.

See ya, mate.

Now, you have to finish that\
before we get on the ferry, Muffy.

Ahhh!

Right, do you know what you want?

Yes. I'd like mango, please.

OK. One mango, please.

And extra big size.

Extra small size, thanks.

Oh, no fair.\
Highly fair.

Bluey, what about you?

I can't decide.

I want either mango like Bingo\
or strawberry.

Can I have two flavours?\
No.

Oh, no fair.\
Very fair.

OK. I'll get strawberry, please.\
In a cone.

I can always have a lick of Bingo's.

$6, please.\
Thank you.

What flavour are you getting, Dad?

I'm not getting one.\
Gotta stay in shape.

It's just coming up.

It's taking a while.

Ready.\
Oh, go on.

Give us a double chocolate\
in a cup, extra large.

Hooray!

I've got a problem.

Everyone happy?

Yep.\
Good.

Is yours nice, Dad?\
Yeah, it's chocolate.

Bingo, can I have a lick\
of your mango?

Here we go.

OK, but only if I can\
have a lick of yours.

Sure.

Ah, not a big lick.

I wasn't gonna take a big lick.

You were.\
Your tongue was all the way out.

No, it wasn't.\
It was. It was like this...

Yahhh...

No, it was only out this far. Blah...

No, it was out this far.

It wasn't.

It was out this far.

It has to be out this far.

OK.

OK, that's OK.

Hang on. If I lick first\
and you lick second,

you could just take\
a bigger lick than me.

Uh, Bluey.

No, I won't.\
You will.

You lick first, I'll lick second.

But then YOU'LL just take\
a bigger lick.

I won't, I promise.\
You will.

OK, kids, come on. Sort it out.

We can't both lick second.

What are we gonna do?

I know. Let's lick at the same time.

Oh, yeah. Good idea, Bingo.

OK. You ready?\
Yes.

So, we both take the same size lick,\
OK?

OK. Show me how big\
your tongue is out.

Blah.\
OK, that's OK.

Show me yours.\
Blah.

Is mine OK?\
Yeah.

Well, let's go.

Uh...\
No, your tongue's out too far.

But, but...

Bingo, not that much.

Ooh, ooh...

Kids, what are you doing?

That's too much.\
No, tongue back in, tongue back in.

Not too big.

No, back, back.\
Oh, not too much.

Uh! Get out of it.

Ahh! My ice-cream!

It's melted!

Mine too.

They're both melted.

Dad, our ice-creams melted.

It's a hot day, kid.\
You had 'em out in the sun.

The sun melts ice-creams.

But that's not fair.

It's about as fair\
as it gets, actually.

Can you buy us another one?

Zero chance.

Ohh!\
Oh, why not?

'Cause it's not my fault\
they melted.

You took too long to eat 'em.

So, we get nothing?

Well, you get\
a valuable life lesson.

I don't want a valuable line lesson.

I just want an ice-cream.

Alright, I tell you what.\
You kids can have mine.

Really?

Yeah, go on.

Yeah! Thanks, Dad!

Huh?

Let's take turns.

You go first.

Have as much as you like.

Thanks, Bluey.

Is it good?\
Mm, yeah.

Your turn. I only took a little bit.

Thanks, Bingo.

Well done, girls.

Mm, it's even better than mango.

Yeah, it's chocolate.

I'm sorry you don't\
get an ice-cream, dad.

It's all good, kid. I'm fine.

Well, it's actually your job\
to give us your ice-cream.

Oh, is it now? And why's that?

'Cause you're the big daddy man.

Fair enough.

# "Dunny" (Season 2 Episode 48)
(UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYS)

So it's a vegetable, we all like it,\
and it starts with B.

Yes.

Broccoli.\
No.

Beetroot.\
No.

Beans.\
Uh-uh.

Booger beans.\
MUM AND DAD: Bluey!

Booger beans aren't a vegetable.

Oh, this is impossible.

We give up. What is it, Bingo?

Botato.

ALL: Oh, Bingo!

What?\
Potato starts with a P.

Oh! (GIGGLES)

Come here.\
Oh, look at this cute little bottom.

(GIGGLES) I need the toilet.

Oh, OK.

Me first!

Hey!

Are you busting, Bingo?

Nah, not really.

Can we play Three in the Bed\
and the Little One Said

while Dad's in the dunny?

Yeah!

Bluey, can you say toilet\
instead of dunny, please?

Why can't we say dunny?

Is it a rude word?

No, it's not a rude word.

I just prefer toilet.

Would the Queen say dunny?\
Uh, no.

It is not a word\
the Queen would use.

Then I'm not saying it either.

Chloe's parents let her say it.

Well, then that's fine for Chloe.

She can say it.

But how come\
she can say it and we can't?

Because different families\
have different rules.

And in this family,\
we don't say dunny.

Dunny's free.

(KIDS GIGGLE)

BOTH: Dad said it, Dad said it!

Said what?

I was just telling Bluey\
to say toilet instead of dunny.

What's wrong with dunny?

It's not a word the Queen would use.

And if we can't say it,\
then you can't say it, Big Daddy.

Right, so we can't say dunny.

BOTH: No.\
But booger beans is fine.

(BOTH GIGGLE)

Bandit.\
Whatevs.

The toilet is free.

(BOTH GIGGLE)

This episode of Bluey\
is called Dunny.

I'm just going to the toilet.

Oh, Bingo, have you not\
learned to walk yet?

(GIGGLES) Yes, I... (GIGGLES)

Did we not teach this kid to walk?\
Let her go to the toilet.

Oh! Our child is taking\
her first steps. I'm so proud.

Mum, am I allowed to say duneep?

No, Bluey.

But I'm not saying dunny,\
I'm saying duneep.

I made it up.

Then yes, you can say it.

But if you make up words, no-one\
will know what you're talking about.

Dad will. Watch.

Huh?\
(BABBLES)

Wow!\
Are you serious?

(BABBLES)

I've never considered it\
from that angle before.

(BABBLES)

This changes everything.

(LAUGHS) See?

You're both crazy.

Do we get in trouble\
if we say dunny?

Yeah, you get squish squashed.

What's squish squashed?

Well, say dunny and find out.

Ooh! Dunny!

(CLICKS)

Squish squash!\
(LAUGHS)

Clear?\
Yes.

But what if YOU say it?

I'll never say it.

Oh, man, Bingo's\
taking ages in the dunny.

Mum! Mum! You said dunny.\
It wasn't me!

Maybe she fell in the dunny.

You said it again!\
You said it again! Yes!

Come here, you little munchkin.

I think if you say it,\
we should get chocolate.

OK, deal.\
Yay!

Bingo, we have to make Mum say it.

OK, but how?

Ooh, I know.\
Let's play pass it on.

Move a bit, Daddy.\
You're swappin' with me.

OK, ready?\
BOTH: Ready.

I like pink biscuits\
for my morning tea,

especially if I'm riding\
a horse to the moon,

because I like the moon\
in the morning.

(WHISPERS)

(LAUGHS)

(WHISPERS)

OK. Go, Mum. What did I say?

Um... Good morning.

I like the moon's biscuits\
'cause they're better than the moon.

And it's morning tea.

No!

No, that wasn't it, Mum.

Well, what did you say?

I like, um...

I forget!\
Keep it simple!

(LAUGHS)\
My turn!

Alright, everyone swap.\
Mum, you stay there.

OK.\
Ooh, ow, ow.

OK, Bingo.\
You know what to do.

Oh, man, I need the dunny.

(BOTH GIGGLE)

Oh, man, I need the dunny.

Oh, man, I need the dunny.

What did I say?\
Yeah, what did she say?

And you have to say it out loud.

I ran to feed the bunny?

BOTH: No!

So, Sam, you feed my tummy?

BOTH: No!

That wasn't it.

She said, "Oh, man,\
I need the dunny."

Squish squash!

OK, OK.

That's enough squish squash.

Oh, I wish we could say dunny.

Oh yeah, why's that?

I just like it.

It rhymes with funny.

Look, I just want us to use\
nice words,

so everyone thinks\
we're a nice family.

Oh.\
Is that an OK thing to want?

ALL: Yeah, that's OK.\
Thank you.

Let's play Four in the Bed.

ALL: OK.

BOTH: Hooray!

Ready?\
OTHERS: Ready.

ALL: There were four in the bed\
and the little one said...

Roll over, roll over.

So they all rolled over\
and one fell out.

(ALL LAUGH)

There were three in the bed\
and the little one said...

Roll over, roll over.

So they all rolled over\
and one fell out.

(LAUGHS)

There were two in the bed\
and the little one said...

Roll over, roll over.

But the big one said, "Nup."

Hey! Roll over!

Mum, our family rules\
are to not say dunny, right?

That's right.

'Cause toilet is a better word.

Well, I think so.

And Chloe's family rules\
are that they can say dunny.

Yes.

So does that mean\
our family rules are better

than Chloe's family rules?

Well, um...no.

They're just different.

But you said toilet is better.

Um, yeah, I did.

Get out.

Bandit!

There was one in the bed\
and the little one said...

..goodnight.

And one more question.

Is our family better\
than Chloe's family?

No!

Mum, can I still\
say dunny in my head?

Oh, booger beans.

Alright, new family rule.

We can all say dunny.

KIDS: Hooray!

Just not in front of the Queen.

ALL: Dunny, dunny, dunny!

Thanks, Mum.\
That's OK.

It's not like it's a naughty word.

Chloe isn't allowed to say naughty.

She has to say cheeky.

Well, there you go.

# "Typewriter" (Season 2 Episode 49)
Tick, tick, tick, ching!\
Tick, tick, tick, ching!

Hey, Bluey, Calypso's\
telling a story!

Ooh.

There once was an old dog\
who had sat on a chest

by the side of the road\
for all his life,

begging for treats.

Oh. Ooh. Mm.

Up you get, Snickers.

One day, a gnome came by\
and said to the old dog,

"Have you tried opening that chest\
you sit on to see what's inside?"

"Oh, no, of course not.

"There's nothing inside.\
It is empty."

Can I sit next to you, Coco?\
Mm.

But the gnome insisted\
that the old dog open the chest

and when he did, he discovered

that it was full of treats!

Ooh.

Huh? That doesn't make any sense.

Aah! Ooh.

This episode of Bluey\
is called Typewriter.

Why didn't the old dog\
look in the chest sooner?

I'm not sure.

Well, I'm going to write a story

where he looked in the chest\
straightaway and he saw the treats.

Hey, where did the real typewriter\
go?

I don't know.

I'll go ask Calypso.

I can't be a storywriter\
without a real typewriter.

Hey, Snickers, what's wrong?

Everyone else has learnt to sit\
except me.

But you're a sausage dog,\
it's gonna take you longer.

Why?\
'Cause you're longer.

Oh. I hate being a sausage dog.

Why don't you come with me\
to see Calypso?

Maybe she can help you too.\
OK, thanks, Bluey.

Hey, Winton, what's wrong?

Everyone keeps running away from me.

Oh, no, they don't.

They do.\
Ah! Winton...

Well, why don't you come\
and see Calypso with us?

Maybe she can help.\
OK, let's get going.

I'll follow you.

Oh, no!\
The English are approaching!

Archers, ready.\
Ready!

Hold and fire.

Pling!\
And fire!

Pling!

Hey, we're shooting bows and arrows\
at you.

Not real ones.

They're pretend real.

We're not playing your game,\
we're going to see Calypso.

I'm looking for the real typewriter.

Oh.

Please can you pretend\
that they're pretend real?

Oh, OK.

Arrows! Get down!

Whoa! Argh!

Hooray! Pling.

And fire!\
Pling.

How are we gonna get past them?

Snickers, you sneak around them\
through those skinny trees.

And then wait at the top of the hill\
to do you know what.

Oh, yeah, OK.

Run your little sausage dog legs!

They're trying to outflank us.

I'm going into those skinny trees.

Oh! Why do YOU get to\
go into the skinny trees?

Because you got to sit\
in the boot seat this morning,

even though it was MY turn.

'Cause I said, "Boot seat!"\
at breakfast before you.

Oh, alright.

For Scotland!\
For Scotland!

Pling, pling, pling.

I'm coming.

Where are you?

What was that?

He-he-he.

Why aren't they attacking us?

I don't know.\
Well, I'm going to scout.

Oh, why do you get to scout?

'Cause you got to sit closest\
to the tap last night.

Even though I said, "Close tap"\
first

on the way back from jiu jitsu.

Oh, alright.\
For Scotland!

One's coming!\
What do we do?!

I know. When he comes, ask him\
a question and then he'll run away.

OK.

Wait, what question?

Any question. It doesn't matter.

Ask him if he's gluten-free.

Alright then.

Wait, why will he run away\
if I ask him if he's gluten-free?

'Cause you're a space invader.

Oh, OK.

Wait, what's a space invader?

It's someone who stands too close.

Like what you're doing right now.

Oh.

Most people stay about\
this far apart.

But you don't,\
you get right up close.

'Cause I'm a space invader?\
Yeah.

Oh.

Is that why people keep on\
running away from me?

Yeah, probably. Try it.

Freeze.

Are you gluten-free?\
Ah!

Winton, not so close.

Just tell me. Are you gluten-free?

Argh!\
Aha! You're right, Bluey!

Come on.

Where are you?

Hey!

Argh! Archers ready.

Pling, pling! Pling, pling.

How are we gonna get past the arrows?

Use a shield.

But I don't have a shield.

Use this one.

Oh, thanks. Hang on.

Pling, pling. Oh! Pling.

Pa-doing.\
Huh?

Pling.\
Pa-doing.

Hey, I'm shooting bows and arrows\
at you.

Yeah, and I'm pa-doinging them\
with my shield.

Oh, no!

Pling, pling, pling.\
Pa-doing, pa-doing, pa-doing.

Come on, Winton!

Get 'em. Ya!

Oh, no, they're catching up to us!

Snickers, now!

Sausage rolllll.

I love being a sausage dog!

Hooray!

Good one, Snickers!

Hey, Winton, look.

I'm not a space invader!

Hey, wait up, guys.

Let's play that again.

Hi, Calypso.

Hello, Bluey. How can I help you?

I can't find the real typewriter.

Oh, are you being a story writer?

Yes.\
Well, it's around here somewhere.

Hmm.

Oh, hey, how did you get past\
the terriers?

I used a shield. See?

Ting, ting.\
Ting, ting.

That's a nice shield alright.\
Thanks.

OK, typewriter. Where is it?

Oh, what if I asked you to show\
me a typewriter?

Hmm...

Tick, tick, ching.

That's a lovely typewriter,\
isn't it?

Yeah, it is.

Thanks, Calypso.

I'm going to write my story now.

OK, have fun.

# "Baby Race" (Season 2 Episode 50)
Mum, am I better\
at the monkey bars than Bingo?

Well, you are two years older\
than her, Bluey.

Am I better than Judo?\
You're about the same as Judo.

I'm not. Judo can't do skip bar\
or backwards one bar.

Well, she'll get there one day.

But am I better than her on THIS day?

Bluey, just run your own race.

Huh? What does that mean?\
Come here.

Have I told you the story\
of when you took your first steps?

Oh no.

Well, it all started\
when you were still a baby.

Oh...

Come on, Bluey, roll over.

Roll over.

You learned to roll over\
really early.

Bandit!

She rolled over! She rolled over!

Huh?

She's not meant to do that\
for ages.

Aww, that's my girl.

Oh!

Hang on. Where was I?

You weren't born yet, sweetheart.

Ooh, I was invisible.

Were you proud of me\
for rolling over so soon?

Yes, a little too proud.

I think I may have turned\
into a bit of a show-off.

Oh, I've never heard of a baby\
rolling over that early.

I know.\
She's just special.

But then one day\
at mothers' group...

It is very early to roll over.

Oh, you're so clever, Bluey.

Ooh! She's sitting.\
She's sitting.

Oh, Judo, you're sitting\
all by yourself.

Oh, goodness.\
That's very early to be sitting.

Oh, well, you know, it's not a race.

But it was a race.\
A baby race.

This episode of Bluey\
is called Baby Race.

I don't know what got into me,\
but I was determined

I'd get you walking\
before Judo's mum, I mean, Judo.

There you go.

Steady...

Bandit! She's sitting!

Huh? Arrgh!

Good gir... Argh!.

But after a lot of practice,\
eventually you sat up.

Bluey, you're sitting!

Oh, goodness, I just can't keep\
track of them.

Judo crawled before me as well?!

Judo beat you again.

And just what did you do about this?

Well, I tried my best.

This thing, how do you...

Come on, Bluey, crawl to mama.\
You can do it.

You can do it.

Did I do it?

Not exactly.

Why was I rolling?

I don't know, kid,\
you didn't come with instructions.

The doctor said\
there was nothing to worry about.

Some babies just roll\
before they crawl.

But I wasn't having that.

♪ 99 bottles of thing\
on the wall...

Aha!

It's fun to crawl.

Oh, how good is crawling?

It's better than rolling.

Arghh!!!! My knees.

Did I do it?\
Did Bluey crawl?

Not exactly.

Come on, Bluey. You can do it.\
Crawl to me.

Oh, yeah, bum shuffle.

Bum shuffle?!

Bum shuffle.

You were a bum shuffler.

Whoo-hoo! Go, Bluey.

Meanwhile, Judo\
was pulling herself up on furniture,

which is the step\
right before walking.

And I was just bum shuffling around?

You are definitely\
not winning the baby race.

The doctor said\
there was nothing to worry about.

Some babies just bum shuffle\
before they crawl.

But I wasn't having that.

See. Feels good, doesn't it?

Feels like you want to crawl,\
right?

Did she crawl?\
Yes.

Hooray!

Backwards.

Beep! Beep! Beep!

The doctor said\
there was nothing to worry about,

but Nana wasn't having that.

Let's stop mucking around, eh?

A bit of olive oil\
on those knees will do the trick.

But how is olive oil\
going to help...? Whoop!

Oh, my goodness.\
Mum! What are you doing?

If she can't crawl,\
she'll have to walk.

This isn't legal anymore.

Whoop!

I'll sprinkle some grit down too.

Ooh! Where'd they go?

Your nana's old school.

None of it mattered, though.

Judo had won the baby race.

Oh, biscuits!

Were you upset with me\
that I lost the baby race?

No, sweetie.

Look, we were all learning\
to do things for the first time.

I just felt like\
I was doing everything wrong.

Aren't you going to mothers' group?

Yes. What a cute cap.

It's like he was born in it.

But then one day Coco's mum\
came to see me.

Hi, Chilli.\
Bella.. Oh, hello.

I'm so sorry. The house is a mess.

We chatted for a while\
and then she showed me a photo.

Are these all your children?\
Yep.

I thought Coco was your first.

No, I've got eight kids.

Wait, no, nine.\
I had no idea.

Wow. You must have learned\
a thing or two.

I have. And there's something\
you need to know.

What?

You're doing great.

Are they happy tears, Mum?

Yeah. Happy tears, honey.

From then on,\
I decided to run my own race.

Whoa, whoa, whoa!\
Whoa!

Yeah! Bluey wins!

Well done, Judo, you clever girl.

So, did Bluey ever learn to walk?

Yes, honey.\
In the kitchen, actually.

Why did I decide\
to walk in the kitchen?

I don't know, sweetie.

Maybe you just saw something\
you wanted.

Don't worry.\
She does that to everyone.

You're going to be late for work.

Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

You've got to keep your eye\
on the ball, mate.

Oh, Bartleby, I'm so sorry\
Dad broke your arm.

Oh, Trix, I can do the gravy\
if you like.

Oh, I'm fine, Chris.\
I've just got some packets.

Oh, no. Let me do a proper one.

Aunt Trixie, can I borrow a towel\
for Bartleby, please?

Oh, Nana, would you be able\
to grab a towel for Bluey, please?

Oh, sure.

Did you get wet, Bartleboy?

Dad landed on him.

Oh, deary me.

(YELPS) Nana, no.

What?

He's got a broken arm.

Oh, goodness me, I had no idea.

Sorry, Bumblebee.

Hey, Uncle Red and Aunt Frisky\
are calling.

Stripe, are you sure you know\
how to do the crackling, mate?

Read the apron!

(LAUGHTER)

Oh, I wish you guys could be here.

Yeah, me too, Mum.

Look what I got for Christmas,\
Uncle Red.

Wow, look at that.

Ah, Muffin!\
(LAUGHS)

Hey, where's Bluey?

I'm sorry it's been a bit crazy,\
Bartleby.

I hope you're still having\
a good time.

What's that?

What? You want to go home?

Hey, Bluey, look who it is.

Frisky!

Hey, Bluey. Merry Christmas.

Merry Christmas, Frisky.

Who's that you've got there?

This is Bartleby. He's having\
his first Heeler Christmas.

Oh, how's it going?

Well, not good.

He got attacked by a crocodile,

then Dad broke his arm,

then Nana jiggled it all about.

Oh, dear.

He wants to go home.\
He says my family is too rough.

Here, let me have a word with him.

Ooh, OK.

Nice to meet you, Bartleby.\
I'm Frisky.

I'm new to the Heeler family\
as well.

And just between you and me...

(YELLS GIBBERISH)

..they're a bit crazy.

Hey!

(LAUGHS)

But give them a chance.

You'll see.

Yeah, but that's not why\
I voted for him.

Oh, Stripe, this crackling!

Oh, really?

They're full of love.

Ah, Bartleby, where are my keys?

Quick! Ferry's leaving!

Oh, come on! Bye, kids!

# "Easter" (Season 2 Episode 52)
Big sleep tonight, kids.\
The Easter Bunny's coming!

I wonder how many eggs he'll leave\
you in your Easter pouches.

How do we know\
he won't forget us again?

Yeah, like he did last year.

Look, we've been through this.

He didn't forget you.

He was just late.

He explained it all in his letter,\
remember?

"Dear Bluey and Bingo.

"So sorry I was late\
with your Easter eggs.

"I had some family stuff on.

"I won't go into it.\
Big love, Easter Bunny."

See? He was just busy.

BLUEY AND BINGO: OK.

We promise he won't forget\
this time.

Oh, goodness!

Ah, we'll clean it up\
in the morning.

Night, kids.

Bluey.\
Yeah, Bingo?

Why did the Easter Bunny\
only forget us?

I don't know.

Do you think he'll remember us\
this time?

Yeah. I do.

Night, Bingo.

This episode of Bluey\
is called Easter.

It's Easter! Bingo, wake up!\
Yahh!

Did he come?

I'm not sure.

I can't see any eggs.

Mine's empty too.

He forgot us again.

Wait.\
What is it?

It's a box.

Eee! The eggs must be inside!

It's empty.\
Aww...

Let's check yours again.

There's something!

Oh, it's just a buh.

He doesn't care about us.

He does, Bingo.

I think these are clues to where\
he's hidden our Easter eggs.

Hmm...

Oh! I know!

Letter, box.

BOTH: Letter box!

Come on!

Are the eggs in there?

No. Just a chatterbox.

Is it from the Easter Bunny?\
It is!

Look!\
(SQUEALS)

Easter...egg.

Hmm.

What's your favourite colour?

Blue. Like you.

It's a cook's hat with an egg.

What does it mean?

Well, cooks work in the kitchen...

Maybe the Easter eggs\
are in the kitchen.

Yeah!\
(BOTH LAUGH, SQUEAL)

The Easter Bunny knows\
my favourite colour.

I told you he cares about you.

Happy Easter!

Hey!\
Hi!

Sorry, Mum!\
We're looking for the Easter eggs.

They could be anywhere.

Bluey, look! It's an egg!

Whoa!

(SQUEALS)

Ah, they're not in here.

Aw...\
Wait! Look at the normal eggs.

Huh?

The Easter bunny doesn't bring\
normal eggs,

he brings chocolate eggs.

I know, but look at the end one.

Huh?

One egg is a kiwi.

Maybe there's chocolate inside.

Dad, is there chocolate in this?

Let's see.

No. No, chocolate.

Aw...

(GASPS)

I think I know where the eggs are!

The kiwi rug.

I'll look under it.

Hmm. I can't see them.

Aw...

Maybe the Easter bunny just likes\
other children more than me.

No, Bingo, he likes you.

It's just that...\
Ah, look!

It's an arrow!

It's pointing to the backyard!

Come on!

You look over there.

I don't remember that sandcastle.

Hey, Bingo.

Are the pointseanna flowers\
normally in a straight line?

Hmm...

Usually they're more\
higgelty piggelty.

I think it's a picture.\
A picture of what?

I don't know,\
but I know how to find out.

Come on!

Wow!

It's a castle!

Our eggs must be in the castle.

There's a castle in London.

We got to get to the airport!\
No, Bluey.

I think it's a different castle.

I think it's this one.

Ah!

(SQUEALS) I hit something!

Is it chocolate?

It is! It is!\
Eep!

Wait...

It isn't.

It's toilet paper.

Ahh!

Hang on. Look! Eggs!

It's another clue. Come on!

Ahh! (LAUGHS)

You look over there.

There's no eggs in here.

There must be.

Toilet paper belongs in the toilet.

Unless...

Oh, no!\
(DRAMATIC MUSIC)

What?

They might be in Dad's toilet!

(DRAMATIC CHORDS)\
(BOTH GASP)

Oh! Bandit.

Oh, it stinks!

How are we going to find\
the next clue?

Someone has to go in there.

But it stinks so much we'll die!

I know.

Aw! There will be no Easter.

Yes, there will be, Bingo.\
I'm going in.

Uh, it stinks.

I...can't...do it...

Wait.

Gah! (HACKS)\
Did you find it?

Bleugh!

Oh, I know what this is.

It's our window!

They must be in here!

But we've already looked here.\
I don't understand.

I do.

He forgot us again.

Maybe you're right, Bingo.

(GENTLE MUSIC)\
It's my fault, Bluey.

I'm just a small, forgettable child.

No, you're not, Bingo.\
You're a great child.

Really?\
Yes. You're smart.

You figured out the castle clue\
all by yourself.

Yeah, I did.

It's me who is forgettable.

You are not.

You're brave.

You went into Dad's stinky toilet.

Hey, yeah, I did.

We're not forgettable.

Yeah, we're rememberable.

Happy Easter, Bluey.

Happy Easter, Bingoooh!

Look!\
(GASPS)

Footprints!

(WHISPERS) Bunny footprints!

BOTH: Easter Bunny footprints!

(EXCITING MUSIC)\
(BOTH SQUEAL)

(MUSIC SWELLS)\
(GASPS)

(TRIUMPHANT MUSIC)

He remembered us.

# "Perfect" (Season 3 Episode 1)
OK, let's make some\
Father's Day cards for Dad.

I'm going to do\
a red love heart rainbow card.

Oh, great!

Hey, what's going on?

ALL: Argh! Dad, get out!

Oh! After all I've done\
for this family!

OK, what about you, Bluey?

I'm gonna draw\
the perfect picture of me and Dad.

The perfect picture?

Yes.

What does perfect mean?\
I know!

It means really, really,\
really, really, really, really,

really, really, really good.

Pretty much.\
(GIRLS GIGGLE)

This episode of Bluey\
is called Perfect.

This is going to be so perfect

Dad will stick it\
straight on the fridge.

Perfect is tough, Bluey.

I'm just warning you.\
It's fine.

Oop! It's not straight.

Start again. It has to be perfect!

What should I draw me and Dad doing?

How about just standing\
there with your arms out,

exactly like this one?

No, it has to be better than that.

But this one's lovely.

But it's not on the fridge.

Uh, no, I guess not.

What do you like the best\
of what Dad does?

Ooh, I know!

I love it when he does, "It's Dad!"

(GIGGLES) Oh, yeah!

It's Dad!

OK, listen up.

Whenever I walk into a room,\
everyone has to clap and go,

"Whoo! Yeah! It's Dad!

"Alright! That guy's awesome!"

Got it?\
OTHERS: Got it.

OK, let's try that again.

It's Dad!

(CLAPS SLOWLY)

(GIRLS GIGGLE)\
Pick up your game!

That looks great, Bluey!

Mm, I can't draw tickling\
very perfect.

Yeah, it looks\
more like he's throwing you.

Ooh, I can draw throwing!

Ooh, you can draw No Ticket!

And he built his house out of straw.

Hm, bad move, pig.

(CLEARS THROAT) Ticket.

Oh, yes. Here you go. (GIGGLES)

P-chuck. Ticket.

Oh, yes, of course.

Oh, what did I do with it?\
It's here somewhere.

(WARNINGLY) Ticket.\
Oh, here it is!

P-chuck. Quicker next time.

Ticket.

Oh, uh, I don't have one.

(SHRIEKS)\
(GRUNTS)

(GIRLS GIGGLE)\
No ticket.

Beautiful, Bluey.

I think Dad will like that.

Dad's games are always too rough.

Hmm, I'm not very perfect\
at drawing big couches.

It looks great!

Yeah, it doesn't look like\
our couch.

It looks more like a chair.

Ooh! You can draw Dad playing Chair.

Oh, yeah!

(SQUEAKS TOY)

Oh, man, my legs are tired\
from all this child rearing.

Surely sitting down on a comfy chair\
will do the trick.

Oh, look, I have my choice\
of any chair I want.

Where to sit?

Here will do.\
(SHRIEKS)

Dad! (GIGGLES) Get off!\
Oh, wow.

Sitting in this chair\
was definitely the right decision.

(GIGGLES)\
So relaxing!

Get off!

The chair looks like a chair.

Good to go.\
But you're not really in it.

Yeah, it's supposed to be\
a picture of Dad AND me.

Bluey, it's fine.\
It doesn't have to be perfect.

Dad will love anything you do.

So if I gave him this, he'd love it?

(GIGGLES)\
Well, um, yes.

Will he love this?

Yes, he would.

Really?\
This?

OK, OK. Yes.

He'd love it more\
if you put some care into it.

And made it...perfect?

No, not perfect.

Just the best you can do.

Come on, what can you draw\
where we see you and Dad?

With no big couches or tickling.

But throwing is fine.

ALL: Hmm.

GIRLS: Ooh, Boomerang!\
Boomerang?

It was all pretty quick, really.

It was just in and out\
and I even got to keep them.

Oh-oh-oh!\
Whoa!

Hey! Oh, man,\
I'm sick of this boomerang.

Do you want a boomerang, Fido?

No, my boomerang supplies\
are plentiful.

Well, what am I gonna do\
with this boomerang?

Well, maybe just throw\
that boomerang away.

Oh, yes, of course.

I'll throw the boomerang away.\
That will do it.

(GIGGLES)

(GRUNTS)\
Whoa!

There. That's the last we've seen\
of that boomerang.

Because you threw it away.

Look, I'm keen to get it done,

but, Chilli,\
she wants to keep her options open.

But I don't know. Do we want anymore\
of these things running around?

Ooh!\
Eh!

That's a cracker!

(GIGGLES) That's what Boomerang\
looks like.

What's wrong this time?

I don't know.

It's just not perfect enough.

Perfect enough for what?

Is there something\
you want to tell me, Bluey?

Mum, I drew you a picture!

Oh, wow.

Do you like it?

Yeah, it's perfect.\
Hooray!

That's going straight to the fridge.

Not much room up here.

Hmm.

Look, I'm just going to put it\
on top of Bluey's for now.

Oh! Hi, Bluey.

I'm sorry, kid.

I'm not perfect I'm afraid.

That's OK.

Being a parent's tough.

So is drawing.

Yeah, so is drawing.

But, listen, how many times

have you banged your knee\
or scratched yourself

playing with your dad?

Hmm...

No ticket!\
(SHRIEKS, GIGGLES)

Argh!\
Whoop! Ooh!

You right, mate?\
Um, yeah, I just banged my knee.

I am sick of this boomerang!\
(SHRIEKS)

Lots.

And what's the first thing\
he always says?

Um...

Don't tell your mum.

What?!\
(GIGGLES)

It's Dad!

(GROWLS)

Uh, I'll come back later.

What else does he always say?

Well, Bluey, it's a good thing\
you're tough.

It's a good thing you're tough.

It's a good thing you're tough.

So, yeah, drawing is tough, but...

It's a good thing I'm tough?

Yep!

Finished!

GIRLS: Happy Father's Day!

BANDIT: Oh, thanks, kids!

Oh, look at these pictures.\
These are brilliant!

They're going\
straight to the fridge.

Out of the way, power bill.

(BOTH GIGGLE)

There.

Perfect!

And then it was Bingo's first bed.

Then she moved into my room?

And now it's no-one's.

Alright, so we're dumping the cot?

Yes, what about Gloria?

She was a Christmas present to me\

But you didn't get\

'Cause he forgot I was born.

Yes, he forgot you were born.

So you said, "It's OK, Bingo,\

Oh, yes. We are. (GIGGLES)

All we can do\
is try harder this time.

That's the way. See, Mum?\
Losing doesn't stop THESE kids.

It sure doesn't.\
Ready, set, go!

Hey!\
(GIGGLES)

That was a good start, but\
there's no way you're gonna beat me!

Hey, what?\
This wasn't this low before.

Ha-ha! See ya!

Come on, Bluey!

(GRUNTS)

I won!

Sherbet!

Give it up, big guy! It's over!

Grr.

Oh, I love you, sherbet.

Well done, Bluey! You won!

What's up, Bluey?\
Not enjoying your sherbet?

No.\
Tastes a bit sour, right?

Yeah!

Sherbet's MEANT to taste sour.

I think I want to beat Dad\
fair and square.

Yeah, I think you do too.

Come on.\
What?! No! But we won that!

It will taste so much sweeter\
when you win fair and square.

But sherbet's not meant to be sweet.

OK, the key to this one -\
use the ball to speed you up.

Hup! You try.

Ready, set, go!

Huh!

Stop!\
We'll work on that.

Don't waste time getting on to your\
bum. Just go down on your belly!

Agh!

That's it! That's it!\
That's it! That's it!

Now, why are you CLIMBING down?\
What do you mean?

Will your dad spend all that time\
climbing down?

No, he would just jump.\
Well, then YOU'VE got to jump.

But it's too high!\
No, it's not.

Come on, Bluey! Hurry!

Isn't there an easier way to be Dad?

I wish there was, kid. Believe me.

But, unfortunately,\
your dad's right -

these obstacles aren't going\
to get out of the way by themselves.

OK.

Huh!\
Yeah!

(PANTS)

Stop! Zero.

Zero!

Oh, no, you pushed the wrong button,\
sweetie. It's this one.

Oh.

Again!

(SPEAKS INAUDIBLY)

How fast can you run?\
As fast as a greyhound!

How fast ARE you gonna run?!

As fast as a greyhound!

(GASPS) Zero.

Alright, winds are favourable.

I've inspected the track this time.\
No little surprises.

How fast can you run?

As fast as a greyhound.

How fast are you GONNA run?

As fast as a greyhound!

A bit more greyhound talk\
than last time, but that's fine.

(CLEARS THROAT) Father, I apologise\
for cheating in our last race.

Oh, well, yeah, good.\
Cheaters never prosper.

Indeed. I wish you good luck.

Uh... You too.

Ready?

Set. Go!

Huh!

What?! How'd you learn to do that?!

Huh! Huh! Huh! Huh!

(GRUNTS)\
Yah!

(GROANS) Huh! Huh! Huh!

Whoo!\
That's it, Bluey. That's it.

Come on, Bluey!

What the...

Come on!

Huh! Huh! Huh!\
Come on, mongoose! (GRUNTS)

I'm gonna win!

(GRUNTS)

MUM AND BINGO: Hey!

What...was that?!

Uh... Yeah... I can't be sure.

You cheated!

Well... Did I?

MUM AND BINGO: Yes!

Ah, who can say for sure?

When the mongoose\
is moving at full speed,

you know, it's all a bit of a blur.

I think the mongoose\
couldn't handle losing to a child.

You get zero.

Alright. Alright.\
Rematch? Rematch? Rematch?

Bluey?

Let's settle it\
with a game of...

..memory snap.

Oh, biscuits.

Uh... Giraffe.

Uh...

Oh, where was that other giraffe?

Oh, monkey?!\
(GIGGLES)

Giraffe, giraffe. Monkey, monkey.\
Eagle, eagle.

How do you do that?

You might as well start now, Bingo.

Hooray!

Greyhound, greyhound. I win!

Argh!

# "Promises" (Season 3 Episode 4)
There! Tidy.

Bluey!

What?!

I JUST tidied.

What are you doing?!

Panda puzzle!

But Dad's about to take you\
to the Trampolinium.

It won't take long.\
The pieces are big. See?

Alright. But promise me\
you'll tidy it up when you're done.

I promise.

Alright! Trampolinium!

Yeah!

Bluey! Puzzle!

I'm not done!

Ooh, Dad, can we go to the library?

No, mate, we're going\
to the Trampolinium.

What about after?

Uh... Yeah, Ok, we can go after.

Do you promise?\
Yeah, I promise.

Hooray!

- Whee!\
- Whoo!

Whee!

- Time to go, kids!\
- No! No!

Come on! It's almost dinner.

Just one more minute!

You've had 21 more minutes.

Run, Bingo!

That's it, I'm coming in.

Whoa! Hey! Get back here!

Whoo!

Argh!\
Argh! Stop it!

Oh, Dad, can we go\
to the library now?

No, it's closed, mate.

But you said we could go\
after the Trampolinium.

Yeah, but we stayed way longer\
than I thought.

But...you promised.

Oh, man.

This episode of Bluey\
is called Promises.

Night, kids.\
Night, Dad!

Hm!

Are you're STILL cranky with me?

You said we could go to the library.

It was shut!\
You promised.

And you shouldn't break\
your promise.

Yeah, I know, mate, but...

Why is this panda puzzle\
not tidied up?!

Uh-oh!\
Quick! Hide!

Where is she?

Uh... Where's who?

The kid who broke her promise\
to clean up the panda puzzle.

Ohh! How interesting!

Argh!

Did Bluey break her promise?

Well, you broke YOUR promise,\
so I can break mine.

What?

It's true. Dad broke his promise.

The library was shut!

Seems like\
we've got a promising problem.

Yeah!

OK, from now on,\
no-one makes any more promises.

But you promised\
you'd always love us!

Whoa. I didn't think this through.

Listen, you can still make promises.

- You just have to keep them.\
- OK. Yeah.

That makes more sense.

Phew!

Bluey, from now on,\
we keep our promises.

No matter what!\
No matter what.

Well, goodnight, everyone!

Panda puzzle!\
Argh!

Come on, kids!

Hurry up!

Hey, this morning\
I said to Bingo to hurry up,

and she said, "I am hurry upping!"

Dad, will you play Toddlers with us\
at the library?

I'll play anything with you\
at the library if you hurry up.

Do you promise?

I promise. Now come on!

Bingo, Dad promised\
to play Toddlers at the library!

Yes!

Hey, hang on, what's Toddlers?

Ee! Ee! Ee! Ee!\
THIS is Toddlers?!

Yeah. You have to walk everywhere\
on your knees.

No way!

But a promise is a promise!

Ugh! Fine.

Excuse me.

Huh?

Down here.\
Oh.

Hello.

Me want books for big boys.

Uh... Next to the magazines.

Thanks!

Excuse me, can you help\
my little brother, please?

Oh, yes. Here you go, young man.

Read to me.\
Oh!

Wah.

That was funny.

Yeah, yeah.

Well done for keeping your promise.\
Thanks.

Speaking of - Bluey, do you mind\
if I put my books in your book bag?

Sure!\
You promise you don't mind?

It's only two books.\
Yeah, I promise.

Great! Here they are.

What?!\
Ha!

Wait up!

These books are heavy!

Thanks, Bluey!\
You're your star.

OK, listen, you two.

You can't use promises\
to trick each other.

Ohh!

The whole point of promises\
is to build trust.

If there's no trust,\
none of this is possible.

What, none of the whole world?

None of it.

No libraries, no roads,\
no power lines.

No power lines?!

I'm not sure about that.\
I think we'd still have power lines.

No, we wouldn't.\
Mum's right.

No more promise-y tricks.

OK.

Ooh! Can we play in the playground?!

Yeah, please, can we?

Yes, but it's almost lunch,

so when I say it's time to go,\
it's time to go.

OK, Mum!\
You promise?

We promise!

Flying fox!

Whee!

Oh. Um... I think it's my turn.

It's my turn!

Whee!

Hm!

Bluey! Help!

Are you OK, Bingo?!

I can't get down!

Just climb down the way you came.

It's too high.

This morning I said to Bingo,\
"Please stop whingeing,"

and she said,\
"But I only just started."

Mum, Bingo's stuck!

Oh, goodness!

Come on, Bingo! Jump to me!

I don't want to.

It's fine, honey.\
I'll catch you.

You promise?

I do.

I promise.

Argh!\
Whoa!

My goodness!

Here we go!

Bluey! Lunch! Time to go!

Oh, hey, today I asked Bingo\
to tidy her beads away,

and she said,\
"I'm not interesting in that."

Do you tell stories about us\
when we're asleep?

Get back to bed!

I promise I'll always love you.

Oh, wow. Thanks, girls.

Uh-uh! Down, down. Stay.

We're going\
to make you breakfast in bed.

Oh, great!\
Uh... Just a friendly question...

Don't worry, it won't take long.

Oh, thanks.

Because we know how you get\
when you're hungry.

Cranky!

Stay!

Alright, here's the plan -

I'll make Dad an omelette,

Bluey, you set the brekkie tray

and, Bingo,\
you make the birthday card.

Quickly!\
We don't want Dad getting hungry.

BOTH: OK!

OK, super-quick omelette.

My specialty.

Oh! Hi, Bingo.

Hi.

Are...you going to get started\
on the birthday card?

I already made one at kindy.

Oh! That's lovely!

I want to help you\
make the omelette.

Oh. That's...lovely.

This episode of Bluey\
is called Omelette.

What do we do first?

Well, first we need some eggs.

Ooh, no, I can get them!

Oh. OK!

(CHAIR SCRAPES LOUDLY)\
Oh, Bingo!

That's awfully loud, honey!

Come here, eggies!

Not you, celery!

I'll get that.

Oh. Ha. Do you want me\
to carry those for you?

No! It's OK!

I'm almost there!

Oops!\
It's OK! I'll clean it up.

No, I can do it!

OK. Here's the paper towels.

(GIGGLES)

And... Ah!

I'll make a start\
on the omelette, honey.

I'll just crack the eggs.

Can I help crack the eggies?

Um... Sure, honey.

How about I sort this out\
and you get started on the eggs?

Grab a bowl from the cupboard.\
OK.

(SMASHING)\
(YELPS)

Is this one OK?

Oh, man. I'm getting hungry.

(HUMS)

How many eggs are in an omelette?

Um... Three or four.

I'm hungry!

Better make it four.

One.

Two.

Three.

Come on, Bingo, a bit quicker.

Four... Oh, no!

Agh! One!

Ee! Two!

Agh! Three!

Hey, where's four?

Done. How are the eggs doing, Bingo?

(CRACKS)\
Ooh!

There's four!

Hello?! Is brekkie almost ready?!

It's coming!

OK, birthday boy's getting cranky.\
Let's get cracking, Bingo.

Ha! Get it? 'Cracking'!

(GIGGLES)\
(YELPS)

(SCREAMS)\
Oh, my goodness!

Sorry, Bluey!\
It's OK, I'll clean it up.

Thanks, Bluey. OK, try again, honey.

Agh!\
I'll just hold it for you.

A bit harder, honey.

Give it a good whack.

(GRUNTS)\
Ooh!

(GIGGLES)\
That's too hard.

Oh, uh... No, honey,\
the shells don't go in.

Let's try again.\
OK.

(PHONE RINGS)

Hello?

Hi. Uh...\
Will breakfast be in my mouth soon?

It's on its way!

(QUIETLY)\
I'm just letting Bingo help me.

I don't want to complain, but...\
Agh!

Sorry!\
Was that my breakfast?!

That was a big one.

I've got to go.

Bingo, I might handle the omelette,\
honey.

Oh, you don't want my help?

Um... I do, but it might be quicker\
if I do it.

Oh. OK.

Why don't you help Bluey\
set the breakfast tray?

I don't need help. I'm finished!

Ohh.

Well, um...

Oh, look, Bingo - you could play\
with the salt and pepper soldiers.

You love them.

OK, Mama.

(PHONE RINGS)

It's coming!

Bluey, run this celery up to Dad.

Yes, Mum!

OK. Extra-super-quick omelette.

Also my specialty.

Alright, omelette done.

"Where are you going?" "I'm off\
to guard the queen. That's my job."

"Ooh. I'll come too."

"No, you can't guard the queen."

"Why not?"

"You're not good at it."

"I am. Really, I am."

"No. You better stay at home."

"But I'm a guard just like you."

"Yes, but you're not\
a proper guard like me."

"Oh. OK then."

"Bye!"\
"Bye!"

Doo, doo-doo, doo.

"Hello, Queen."\
"Oh, hello."

(PHONE RINGS)

The number you have dialled\
has been disconnected.

Hey, what?!

Bingo, come here.

I made an omelette for Dad,

but...I didn't make it the right way.

Really?

Yeah.

I need your help making another one.

OK!

Is that an omelette I can smell?

BINGO AND MUM: Get back upstairs!\
It is!

Can I just...\
No! This isn't for you.

Why? Well, who is it for?

You go, I'll take care of Dad.

(GIGGLES)\
Please! I need food!

Maybe...I could eat this...plant.

ALL: Happy birthday!\
Is that food?!

Sure is!\
I made you an omelette.

Give it here!\
(ALL YELP)

(MUNCHES LOUDLY)\
Stand back, Bingo!

Whoa!\
You might lose a finger!

(MUNCHES LOUDLY)

(GLUGS LOUDLY)

(SIGHS)

A-a-a-a-a-a-hh!

Did you like it?

Bingo, I'm gonna\
be completely honest -

that was the best omelette

I've ever had in my life.

OTHERS: Hooray!

Can I have another one?\
Yes!

Let me clean this away for you,\
birthday boy.

No, Mum, I can do it.

Oh! OK.

Thanks, Bingo.

I'll help you!\
Thank you.

I think there are a few eggshells\
in that omelette.

Well, you can't make an omelette

without breaking a few...

We'll clean it up!

Oh, you got no chance, love.

(BOTH IMITATE CAMERA SHUTTERS)

Hey!

Oh, look, Raelene, it jiggles.

(GIGGLES)

Kids, don't take photos\
of people's bottoms.

But we're holiday people.

It's the first time\
we've ever seen this bottom.

Budup. Budup.\
That's a good one.

I don't care. It's rude.

Take photos of something else.

OK, I'll take photos of leafs.\
Leafs are exciting.

Why is it rude to take photos\
of your bottom?

It just is.

But it's just a bottom.

Just trust me.

I've been on this planet\
longer than you.

OK.

If you're looking for something to\
do, the dishwasher needs unpacking.

Dad enters the room.

Dad, look at my leaf photos.

Pretty cool leaves, Bingo.

Dad, can you bend over?\
Bluey!

What?\
No chance, kid.

I wasn't born yesterday.

Huh?\
You weren't born what?

I wasn't born yesterday.\
It's a saying.

It means\
I've been around long enough

to know exposing my rear end\
to you isn't a good idea.

Hee-hee. Born yesterday.

Bingo, I've got an idea.

Is it about\
unpacking the dishwasher?

No.

Dad, can you pretend\
you actually WERE born yesterday?

Yeah!\
Oh, man.

Is it too late to bend over?

BLUEY: This episode of Bluey\
is called Born Yesterday.

BOTH: Ready? And...\
born yesterday!

(SINGS) Aaaaah!

BOTH: Hooray!\
Wow!

My second day on the planet.

Look at all this. It's amazing!

And look at this little blue thing.\
Ohh.

And a red thing!

Hi.\
Agh!

(BOTH GIGGLE)\
It makes noises. Amazing.

Who are you calling 'It'?

We have names.

Oh, I'm sorry.\
I was born yesterday.

I don't know what a name is.

It's something you call something.

Like my name is Bluey.\
And mine's Bingo.

Blue-y.

Bin-go.

BOTH: Yes.

Can I have a name?

You've already got one.\
It's Bandit.

Ban-dit. I like it.

Oh, look at that.

This is the most amazing thing\
I've ever seen.

It's just a stool.

Hello, stool.

My name is Bandit.

BOTH: (GIGGLE) Stools can't talk!

Really? Why?\
They're not alive.

Alive?\
Yeah.

Alive?

No, that's not alive.

Oh! Uh, is it?

That's called food.\
You put it in your mouth.

Why would I put it in my... Ohh.

Oh, I feel like a new dog.

I like food.\
Thanks for the update.

And stools can't talk.

Kids, what have you done\
to your dad?

He was born yesterday.

He doesn't know anything.

Are you alive?\
Yoo-hoo!

Hi, I'm your wife.

My wife?

Yes, and if you want me\
to stay your wife,

you'll learn about dishwashers.

Dishwasher. Wife.

Wow. There's just so much to learn.

Whoa!

This is outside.

You've got some grass and some wood.

A fence.\
Argh! Look out!

BOTH: What is it?

There's a giant fireball\
in the big blue thing.

That's the sun.\
It's meant to be there.

And the big blue thing is the sky.

Oh. Phew.

This is a swing.\
Push me!

Swing.

No, the other way.

Oh, OK.

Swing.

BOTH: (GIGGLE) No!

This way.

Oh, swing.

This is... Oh!\
(BOTH GIGGLE)

So, this is our street.

You've got some cars\
and, ooh, a bird.

Ooh, rubbish.

Ooh!\
Don't worry about the sun.

It's meant to be there.

Uh, OK.

Ah, come on, Bandit.\
Huh?

Keep walking.\
I have a wife.

OK, Bandit, probably\
don't say things about the sun

to people at bus stops.

Yeah.\
Why?

It's hard to explain.

OK, I won't. Food!

(SINGS) Yeah, I got\
my steak and bacon.

Food!\
Oh, hey Bandit. Oi!

BOTH: Agh! Dad. No.

That's my pie!\
Get off it!

Drop!\
Gimme it.

Here!\
Food!

Oh, you ate all the sauce!

Sorry, Lucky's Dad.\
He was born yesterday.

Yeah, I'll say.

(GROANS)\
I can't hold him!

Run, Lucky's Dad.\
But I'm going that way.

Food!\
Just go!

Wah!

Oh. Bye, food.\
Ugh.

You can't just take people's food.\
Why?

'Cause it doesn't belong to you.

B-long?

Yeah, like everyone's stuff\
isn't everyone's, you know?

Everyone?

Look, just don't take people's food.

And don't talk about the sun, OK?

You have to just trust us.\
Why?

Well, because we've been on\
this planet longer than you.

That's true.\
I was only born yesterday.

G'day, Bandit.

I have nothing to say\
about the sun to you.

(BOTH GIGGLE)\
Er, great.

Wow. Name?

Oh, that's called a...\
Wait, Bingo.

It just makes trouble when we\
tell him what things are called.

Why don't we let him enjoy\
just looking at things today?

Yeah, we can teach him names later.

Name?

It doesn't matter. Just look.

Alive.

Hello, stool.

It's OK, Dad.

You can stop playing Born Yesterday.

Oh, you sure?

Yeah, it was fun.\
Yeah, real fun. Thanks.

No worries. I enjoyed it.

I feel like a new dog.

Bingo, can you help me\
unpack the dishwasher?

Sure.

Oh, good on you, kids.

Uh, kids?\

Has your dad\
stopped playing Born Yesterday?

Yeah.

OK.

# Oh! Where is my toast?! #

Bluey! Can you be as quiet as Bingo\
for a bit?

# No! I can't! #

Bluey, I can't find your library\
books, and they're due back.

Have you seen\
Shmurdle, The Dirty Turtle?

# No! I have not seen\
Shmurdle, The Dirty Turtle! #

You have to keep better track\
of your things.

# What about Bingo?! #

Bingo put hers in a neat pile\
when she's read them.

Finished.

Bing! Orders up!

Ooh! Cheese and jam!

Dad, I don't like cheese and jam.

What? I thought you did.

No, Bluey does.

I like banana and peanut butter.

Bleugh.

How can you two come from the same\
parents, be raised in the same house,

but be completely different?!

Don't know.

Well, I'll tell you this for free -

my life would be a lot easier\
if you were both the same.

Tell me about it.

Bingo! I've got an idea!

OK!

Wait, what? Hang on.

Why do you keep setting them up?

What are you looking for?

Hair chalk!

Ooh!

Give me your arm.

This is gonna be great!

Alright, done.

Here you go, Bingo -\
peanut butter and banan...

Agh!

Bleugh.

This episode of Bluey\
is called Mini Bluey.

Aww! So cute!

Let me introduce you to us.

I'm Bluey and this is Mini Bluey.

Hi.

She's just like me. Watch.

Have some cheese and jam,\
Mini Bluey.

We LOVE cheese and jam.

I...love...it.

See?\
This is going to be a long day.

OK, Mini Bluey,\
let's learn about me.

Hmm... Ooh.

I like to say 'serial'\
instead of 'serious'.

Oh, and I'll show you how I dance.

I like to do this sort of thing.

And sometimes this.

Yep, that's it.

And I sort of\
just talk all the time.

It doesn't even need to make sense.\
Just noises are fine.

Bhoot! Bhoot! Bhoot! Bhoot! Bhoot!

Bhoot! Bhoot! Bhoot! Bhoot!\
Bhoot! Bhoot! Bhoot! Bhoot! Bhoot!

AND I like to sing.

# Ohh! Singing things! #

# Ohh! Singing things... #

A bit louder.

# Ohh! Singing things! #

Yeah, that's great.

I like to just leave my toys\
on the ground.

Isn't it better to tidy them away?

Nah, it doesn't make\
much difference.

Agh!

Where is it?!

Bhoot! Bhoot! Bhoot!

I like to ask a lot of questions.

Mum, what are you doing?

You know what I'm doing, Bluey,\
I'm...

But I don't really listen\
to the whole answer.

Ooh, and if I see a bum,

I give it a little bom-di-di-boom.

Hey! Get it out of it!\
Bom-di-di-boom, boop-boop-boop.

Hey, Blueys, I need you to pick up\
these grass clippings

and put them in the wheelbarrow.

Yes, Father.\
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

Where do you think YOU'RE going?

To help Dad. I like wheelbarrows.

BINGO likes wheelbarrows.

BINGO helps Dad.

You're Mini Bluey now.\
Oh, yeah.

And Bluey does not like\
grass clippings.

I'll tell you that for free.

But Dad said we have to do it.

Let's find out if he's serial.

Excuse me, big fella.

Here we go.

These grass clippings\
you're talking about,

why do WE have to put them\
in the wheelbarrow?

They don't belong to us.

Well, you know all that food\
in the fridge?

That doesn't belong to you either.

But, if you want to keep eating it,\
I suggest you get to work.

OK, he's serial.

# Wh-ee-ee-ee-l!

# Barrow! #

Mini Bluey, that's quite loud.

Yeah, Mini Bluey, I don't\
really sing when I'm doing chores.

I usually whinge.

AND do the job a lot slower\
than what you're doing.

Watch.

Ugh!

Why do WE have to do this?

Ugh, it's hot!

OK, you know what?\
Can I order double BINGOS?

No! It's double Blueys for ever!

Whoo-hoo-hoo!

My arms hurt.

Argh!

Double Bingos!

Mm...yeah, here you go.

Start on my tail.

Hi, Dad!

Whoa!

This is a Big Bingo.

Hi. May we help you\
tidy these grass clippings away?

Uh... Yeah.

Come on, Mini Bingo.

Result!

I like to pretend\
I'm hugging a wombat.

Hug!

Hug!

Now I put it to bed. Goodnight.

Nigh-night.

Where ARE you, Shmurdle?

Here he is!

Oh!

Thanks, um...

Big Bingo!

..Big Bingo.

Double Bingo!

I could definitely get used to this.

What?!

Bandit!\
Oh, uh...I didn't mean...

Oh, Bluey, wait.\
Big Bingo!

But, seriously,\
how good's double Bingo?

Yeah, I know.

Hi, Big Bingo.

I wasn't sure which bed to sit on.

Are you OK?

Mum and Dad want two of youse.

They don't want any of mes.

It's very rude.

It's because I'm annoying\
and you're not annoying at all.

Yes, I am. I'm super annoying.

Really?\
Yeah!

I'm just different annoying.

I'll show you.\
Where's the sticky tape?

Here you go.\
Oop, thanks.

And can you find\
the fake teeth for me?

Ooh, OK!

Here you go!

Agh! You look crazy!

Follow me.

Oh, man!

You're freaking me out!

Ooh! Get away from me!

What's going on in...

Agh! Bingo! Stop it!

In here!\
Agh!

That's it, we want one Bluey\
and one Bingo from now on.

You got that?!

OK, she's asleep.

What do you want to\
watch tonight, babe?

Do you watch TV\
after we go to sleep?

Bluey! Not again.\
Come on, back to bed.

I don't want to go to bed.

Too bad, kid.

But why do we have to sleep?

Why can't we just\
stay awake all night?

'Cause that's the way the world is.

Well, I'm going to make it so\
that's not how the world is.

That might be tricky.\
People like to sleep.

Well, I'll take everyone's bed\
to the dump.

Yeah, they'll probably\
just sleep on the couch.

Well, I'll take the couches\
to the dump too.

Oh, sounds like a big job.

You'll need a full night's sleep\
for that.

Yeah, I will. 'Night.

Hey, wait, no!

Ugh. Come on, I'll read you a story.

You know she can't help it.

I know.

Can you help me?

Oh, yeah, I've got an idea.

Wait, is it a bad idea?

Mum, are you grumpy with me?

No, honey, I'm OK.

Come on.

Once upon a time,\
there was a village.

Are you sure you're not grumpy?

No, I just want you to go to sleep.

And in the village...

Hey, hey!\
Unicorse!

Oh, no, not Unicorse.

MUM: This episode of Bluey,\
unfortunately, is called Unicorse.

Budge up, budge up! Watch the horn.\
What are we reading?

Well, it's a story...\
Yawn!

Here, read this.

It's got a unicorn in it.\
I'm not reading that.

Fine, I'll read it.

(READS HALTINGLY)\
Onse up on a tim...

Oh, I wish I could read!\
(GIGGLES)

Unicorse, Bluey is finding it\
a little hard to get to sleep,

so we're actually trying\
to calm things down a bit.

Well, that's gonna be hard\
with me around!

Yeah! (SHOUTS)\
(GIGGLES)

Shh! Bingo's asleep.

I don't care!\
Well, I do.

So how about you\
and your little mate jog on?

I ain't goin' nowhere, toots.

My name is Chilli.

Oh, I'm sorry, Silly.

Chilli.

Billy. Yeah, that's what I said.

Out!\
(WHIMPERS)

Oh, Mum, please can Unicorse stay?

Bluey, he's the most annoying\
unicorn in the world.

Guilty!

But I can turn him\
into a nice Unicorse.

I promise I can. Right, Unicorse?

Nuh.\
Don't listen to him.

Please, can he stay?

Fine. But we're reading\
this book, not yours.

You will live to regret that.

(CLEARS THROAT)

Once upon a time there\
was a village,

and in the village,\
everyone walked around barefoot.

Ah, yay!\
Unicorse, I can't see the page!

Aaaand, why should I care?

Oh, I forgot about the catchphrase.

If you block the words,\
Mum can't read the story.

Aaaand, why should I care?

Because stories are nice.

My story was nice.

It had a unicorn in it.

This one has zero unicorns,\
and the ending's boring.

She just makes sho...\
Ah!

Don't spoil the ending.

Why not?\
'Cause Bluey hasn't heard it.

Aaaand, why should I care?

Unicorse, I'm trying to\
make you a nice Unicorse.

OK, OK, OK.

Please continue, Milly.\
I won't spoil the ending.

Where she makes shoes.

BOTH: Unicorse!\
Haaa!

Whoo-whoo-whoo-whoo.

One day, the Queen decided to\
get off her litter

and have a walk around.

(HIGH-PITCHED VOICE)\
Changed my mind.

Oh, wait, changed it again.

Actually, I will.\
No, not today.

Up, down, up, down, up, down, up,\
down, up, down, up, down...

Unicorse! That is bad behaviour.

Meh-meh-meh.\
Meh-meh-meh-ma-ma-meh.

Oh! So is that.

Meep-meep-meep-meep.

Shall we continue?

Ugh, yes.\
Ha... Meep.

So the Queen walked a few steps,

and stood on a prickle.

Ouch!

Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!

Unicorse, that's mean.

How would you feel\
if you stood on a prickle?

I'd feel good.\
I'd feel so good I'd dance.

(DANCE MUSIC PLAYS)\
You wouldn't dance!

You'd be crying, like the Queen.

Well, maybe she should\
wear some shoes.

Unicorse!\
Ha-ha-ha-ha!

Anyway, the Queen discovered

that her whole kingdom\
was covered in prickles.

What was she to do?

Make shoes.

Ugh. Bluey?

Ooh, I know!

Unicorse, what's\
your favourite food?

Children.

Oh.

Just kidding.\
I like chicken bucket.

Oh, great.\
Look, here's some chicken bucket.

Oh, thank you. Mighty kind.

OK, we're good to go.

So the Queen had an idea.

She will cover\
the whole kingdom in leather.

That way, no one will ever\
stand on the prickles a...

(SNAP!)

..gain.

So she got to work.\
(SNAPS)

All day and night the Queen worked,

covering her whole kingdom\
in leather.

Ugh! Can you please chew\
with your mouth shut?

I can chew with my mouth shut,\
of course I can.

Thank you.

The Queen just...\
But I'm not gonna!

Grr, that's it. I'm out.

Catch you on the flipside, Willy.

Wait, no!\
(DANCE MUSIC PLAYS)

I'm done, Bluey.\
I can handle this, Mum.

Unicorse!\
Ow! My back. My neck!

My back and my neck!\
(GIGGLES)

I just tapped you on the shoulder.

Whiplash! Whiplash!\
Call my lawyer! Ohh.

Look Bluey, good on you for trying,\
but you can't change Unicorse.

Ugh. I think you're right.

I'm not sure you can\
change anyone very much.

Well, what can we change?

Well, we can stop\
letting Unicorse annoy us.

Really, how?\
Maybe we ignore him?

He's pretty hard to ignore.

Let's give it a go.

The Queen just couldn't do any more.

She was too tired.

Oh, here he comes.\
Remember, just ignore him.

(CLEARS THROAT)\
Are you Willy Heeler?

I'm Chilli Heeler.

Mum.\
Oh, yes, sorry.

But then the Jester said\
to the Queen, "Your Majesty,

"instead of covering\
the whole kingdom in leather,

"why not just cover your feet?"

Stop that reading.\
This is a very serious matter.

One of you karate chopped my client.

Karate chopped?

Bluey.\
Oh, yeah, sorry.

So the Queen cut two little bits\
of leather and made them into shoes.

Hey, I'm talking to you.

Yeah, listen to him!

So the people could walk\
anywhere they wanted,

and the prickles couldn't hurt them.

Stop reading!

Unicorse, let me handle this.

Hey, watch it, mate,\
or I'll have to get a little pokie.

OK, as your lawyer, I...\
Here I come!

Oof! Arghh!\
Hey! You're gonna get it!

And they all lived\
happily ever after.

Shall we leave them to it?

Yeah, I'm tired.

You're gonna get it now, mate.

Yah-hah!

(MUSIC RESUMES)

Doing well!

OK, now let's change colour.

Changing colour is tricky.

I wish there was\
a rainbow-coloured yarn.

Oh, tell me about it.

I'm on a quest to find rainbow yarn.

What's a quest?

A quest is like a journey\
a hero goes on.

Oh! How does a quest start?

Well, usually the hero\
starts at home.

They're nice and comfortable.

But then adventure calls!

Alright! Who's coming with me\
to Mackenzie's house?

No, thanks, Dad.\
Mum's teaching me how to crochet.

Well, just you and me, Bingo.

Argh!\
Come on, let's go!

I'm not interested in that.

Why are you going\
to Mackenzie's house?

Curry swap.

What's curry swap?\
It's where you swap curry.

I've made a roghan ghosht

and Mackenzie's Dad\
has made a beef rendang.

I swap a bit of mine for a bit\
of his, then we have two curries.

Oh!

But I need Bingo\
to carry the peshwari naan!

(SQUEALS)

Oh, Mum! It's a quest!

(BINGO GIGGLES)\
Yeah! A curry quest!

Ah!

This episode of Bluey\
is called Curry Quest.

(GROANS) Come on, Bingo!\
No!

Usually the hero finds a reason\
NOT to go on the quest.

(GROANS)\
I want top stay with my mum!

But something\
always changes their mind.

OK, fine, stay.

But you know\
what Mackenzie's Mum has?

Face paints!

Face paints!

Hey, Bingo, peshwari naan!

(GIGGLES)

And so the quest begins.

And what happens on the quest?

Well, the hero\
is out in the wide world now -

all sorts of challenges pop up.

Hey, I didn't say\
could use both legs.

What?

You heard me -\
you only get to use one leg.

(GIGGLES) I can't hop the whole way!

Toughen up, kid.\
This is a curry swap.

(GIGGLES) OK!

And who said\
you could walk forwards?

What?!

Sometimes the hero\
meets friends on the way.

G'day, Doreen!

Hi, Bandit! Hi, Bingo!

Oh, something smells good!

It's a peshwari naan.

Doing a curry swap.

Lucky you.

You're looking forward to tomorrow,\
Bandit?

The friends often warn the hero\
of the danger ahead.

Danger?!

You're not going through the park,\
are you?

Yeah. Why?

Oh, there's a magpie\
protecting his nest.

He swooped me earlier.

Look!

Ooh.

The trick\
is not to take your eyes off him.

If he thinks you're looking at him,\
he won't swoop!

OK.

Ooh! My bus is here!

MUM: There's always danger\
on a quest.

Otherwise it's not a quest.

Ooh, there he is.

Why does he want to swoop us?\
(MAGPIE SQUAWKS)

(DOG SCREAMS)\
He's just being a good dad.

He thinks\
we're trying to hurt his eggs.

But we're not.\
I know, but HE doesn't know that.

Just walk with me\
and remember what Doreen said.

Don't take your eyes off him.

Keep looking. Keep looking.

I can't turn my neck any further.

Walk backwards.

But I can't walk backwards,\
remember?

Oh! Oomph!\
Come on! Come on!

(MAGPIE SQUAWKS)\
(BOTH SCREAM)

(WHIMPERS)\
Argh!

Ooh! That was close.

Look, Dad, we're here!

Curry swap! Whoo!

After facing the grave danger,

the hero arrives\
at where they were going.

Here you go - the naan peshwari.

Cheers, Bingo.

Would you like your face painted,\
Bingo?

Yes, please!

I'm glad you're here, Bingo.

I'm on the face-painting stall at the\
school fair, so I need to practise.

I'm not very good, I'm afraid.

Hey, Bingo!\
Agh!

Is that the end of the quest?

Not yet.

Usually here some secret is revealed\
and the quest takes a turn.

Bingo, you get to go\
to the airport tomorrow!

Airport?\
I'm not going to the airport.

Yeah, you are.

Your dad just told my dad\
he has to fly to work

and he's going to be gone for ages.

What?

Mackenzie!

So, you wait till the END\
to put the curry leaves in.

Dad, are you flying away\
to the airport tomorrow?

Oh...yeah...I am.

How long are you gone for?

Just six weeks.

How long is six weeks?

It's six...weekends.

Oh, that's forever!

It's here that the true challenge\
of the quest is revealed.

We have to head back now, Bingo.

We can't.\
I don't want to go past the magpie.

And I don't want you to leave.

I'm sorry, mate. I don't\
want to go away, but I have to.

But just when things\
seemed the saddest...

Bingo! I've got\
the perfect face paint for you!

You want to know a secret, Bingo?

Yes.

I'm thinking of NOT doing the\
face-painting stall this weekend.

Why?

Because I'm not very good at it,\
am I?

Mackenzie's meant to be a cheetah!

Am I?

But then no-one will be able

to get their faces painted.

No, I guess not.

Well, I think you HAVE to do it.

Even though I don't want to?

Yes. Even though that.

Yeah, you're probably right.

What do you think?!

(ROARS)

I think I'm getting better!

See ya, Border Collies!

Enjoy the curry!\
ALL: See ya!

Good luck with the magpie!

MUM: Now, every good hero\
learns a few things on their quest.

Mackenzie's Mum,\
can you face-paint one more thing?

Ready?

Wraor!

Armed with everything\
they've learned along the way,

the hero faces their ultimate test.

(SQUAWKS)

(SCREECHES)

The end.

You're my hero, Bingo.

(GIGGLES)

(SPEAKS INAUDIBLY)

(SPEAKS INAUDIBLY)

BLUEY: Why do heroes want to go on\
quests, anyway? They seem dangerous.

Well, they usually don't, remember?

Oh, yeah!

But that's what makes them heroes -

they go anyway.

# "Magic" (Season 3 Episode 10)
Done.

Mum, can you play with me?

Oh, you know what, Bingo?\
Not right now, honey.

Oh. Why not?

Well...I just don't feel\
like playing right now.

So?

Bingo!

What?

Hi, Bingo.\
Do YOU want to play, Bluey?

Yeah!

Hooray!

Mum said she wouldn't play with me.

You know there is a way\
you can MAKE people play with you?

Really? How?

You use magic.\
Magic?

Yeah. You can use it\
to make people do anything.

Mum taught me.\
Ooh, show me!

OK, turn around.

Watch. I can make\
your tail go this way.

Oh, Bingo, pretend my hand\
controls your tail.

Oh, OK.

I can make it go this way...

Wow!

..and this way...

..and wag!

Look at it!\
And it's not just tails.

I can do this. Watch!

Ooh!\
Agh!

Teach me!

Um... Sure.

I guess Mum won't mind.

This episode of Bluey\
is called Magic.

OK, Bingo, let's do this.

Try to magic my ears.

Ee! Ee!

It's not working.

You've got to be more dramatic,\
like...

..hm!\
Hep!

You know?

OK, arm up, feet out.

OK, try again.

Ah...hm!

Ah!\
It worked!

You know magic!

NOW if someone\
doesn't want to play with you

you can just make them.

Agh!\
Leapfrog!

See?

Is there anything else\
I need to know?

Well, there was something else\
Mum said, some rule.

Oh, I forget.\
Let's use it on Dad!

Yeah!

I think that's it.\
Looking good.

Hi, Dad.\
G'day, Bingo!

Check out the new grass!

Ooh. It looks great.

Um... Can you play with me?

Oh, not right now, mate.\
We've got to water this in.

Oh...well...that's too bad!

Is there something wrong\
with your arms, mate?

It's not working.

I told you - more dramatic,\
like this.

Hm!

Ee!

Bingo, I think\
you need your racquet restrung.

"Racquet restrung."

I said...that's too bad!

Oh, no! Bingo's doing magic!

Run, Pat!\
Ooh!

Oh, no, you don't!

Hup!

No!

What should we do with them?

Hmm...

This is not fair!

Kids! Stop making us dance!

- Stop it!\
- Whoa!

OK, time for the big finish!

Oh, no.

You better stick the landing, Pat!

It's not up to me!

Oh...

Hooray!

We did it! We did it!

Christmas crackers! You weigh a ton!

Ohh...\
Pat, you're losing me, Pat.

You're losing me!

I love magic!

- What's going on here?!\
- Agh!

Run!\
Oh, no, you don't!

Who taught you how to use magic?

Bluey did.

I should have known.

And did you teach her

the most important rule about magic?

I couldn't remember it.

Agh!

The rule is never use magic\
for cheekiness.

Oh, yeah, that's right!

Oh, Bandit, get your armpit\
out of my face.

You two, get out of here!\
This doesn't concern you.

Whoop!

Bingo, magic should only be used\
to help people.

We WERE helping.

We were helping them learn to dance!

Bluey!\
Ohh!

OK, OK.

No more cheekiness.

Thank you.

Starting tomorrow!

Ohh!

It should be up to us\
how we use our magic!

If we want to be cheeky,\
then we can be cheeky!

It's not YOUR magic,\
it's EVERYONE'S!

Agh! A-a-a-a-a-gh!

Huh!

Hey!

And it's stronger in some\
than others!

Magic should be used for goodliness!

I WAS using it for goodliness!

Bingo was sad\
because YOU didn't play with her!

Now she's happy!\
No!

Whoa!

Grown-ups should play with kids\
whenever the kids want!

Whoa...ugh!

Hee-yah!

Huh?

Grown-ups can't just drop everything\
and play when kids ask them to.

Huah!

Grr!\
Ohh!

Whop!\
Agh!

Why not?

Because then who will do\
all the chores,

like cleaning the house\
and making the dinners?

We'll ring the pizza boy!

Agh! You can't just ring\
the pizza boy!

We can do whatever we want.\
Agh!

Can't we, Bingo?

Um... I guess.

Argh! No, Bingo.

Don't listen to her!

Argh!\
The pizza boy is not the solution!

Bingo, I need your help!

Turn your magic to mine!

People should play with you\
because they WANT to,

not because you make them,

otherwise it's not clean!

Hey, uh...is all that crazy stuff\
still happening?

Argh!

Oh, get off!\
It's not up to me!

You see, Bingo?

Cheeky magic ALWAYS wins.

'Cause we've got tickling!

Argh!\
Tickle, tickle, tickle, tickle!

Tickle, tickle, tickle, tickle!\
Cut it out!

Now, Bingo, ring ALL the pizza boys!

Me?\
Yes, you.

Why do I have to do it?\
Because I said so.

You can't just tell me\
what to do.

Yes, I can.\
Wah!

Tickle, tickle, tickle, tickle!

Stop it!\
Sorry, babe, it's the magic.

Huh?

Huh? Who's doing that?

Bingo! No!

Hee-yah!\
Ohh...argh! Oof!

Hooray! Bingo joined the good side!

Whoo!

I am not an object!

Well, that was a big day.

Nice grass, Dad.

Thanks, kid.

That'll be the pizza boy.

Hooray!\
Come on! Who's coming!

We need a grown-up.

Off you pop.

Actually, I'm pretty comfortable\
right here.

Yeah, but you're still going.\
Are you gonna make me?

If I have to.\
Oh, man.

OK.

I wish I knew magic.

Uh-uh!\
Ohh!

Ohh!

That...was...cheeky.

Whoo!

# "Chest" (Season 3 Episode 11)
Alright, here we go, Bluey.

I'm going to teach you\
how to play chess.

What's 'chest'?

No, not 'chest'.

CHESS.\
Yeah - chest.

OK, fine. I'm going to teach you\
how to play chest.

Ooh! It's like checkers!

Yeah,\
but a lot harder than checkers.

And, so, probably\
a bit old for Bluey, right?

Oh, how old ARE you?

Don't you know\
how old your own child is?!

I think I do, but just tell me.

I'm six.\
Are you still six? Wow.

I'm almost seven.\
Well, I reckon that's old enough.

Can I ask why\
you want to teach Bluey chess?

'Cause smart people play chess.

Can I play?\
She's five.

Well, you might not be\
old enough for chess, Bingo.

But you can WATCH us play.

Ohh!

It's OK, Bingo, you can help ME.

Oh, Bluey.

Thanks, Bluey!

Where's the dice?

This episode of Bluey\
is called Chest.

OK, I'll show you the pieces.

Who are the little bald guys?

They're called 'pawns'.

Prawns?

No, not prawns. PAWNS.

Hello, little prawn.

OK, so the pawns\
can move one square forward.

Well, sometimes two squares,\
but only on their first turn.

And they take diagonally, see?

OK, don't worry about that.

Now this guy is...\
Hang on, who's THIS?

This is Charleville.

And this is Bonny Bombom.

OK, Charleville and Bonny Bombom\
aren't invited.

Ohh!

A horsey!

I've got one too!

OK, so he's the knight.

No, he's a horsey!

Yeah, but he's called the 'knight'.

No, the knight sits ON the horsey.

Well, yeah, that's true.

Everyone knows THAT.

I thought you said SMART PEOPLE\
played chess.

Well, whatever you call him...

Mine's called Gallahop.

Mine's called Daughter of Gallahop.

He moves by jumping.

Oh, yes, horseys love jumping.

Ooh. Who is castle head?

That's the rook.

I'm going to call him Castle Head.

Fine. Castle Head moves straight,\
like this.

Castles can't move!

This game's confusing.

Yeah, it is, Bingo.

Maybe you just\
want to do some colouring.

No! She's on my team.

Oh, right, let's just start.

There. Your go, Bluey.

Ohh! I want my own chest team.

Well, there's only two teams, Bingo,\
so maybe you just watch.

Ohh!

Don't worry, Bingo, look.

There's two horseys, see?

And two Castle Heads.

And two pompom elves?

Bishops.\
And lots of prawns.

Pawns!

So this can be your team,

and this one's mine.

Thanks, Bluey.

Nice one, Bluey.

Uh... Look, that's not...\
Let it go, Deep Blue.

Hang on.\
There's only one crown lady.

And one wedding-cake head.

Ah! Now, that's the king\
and that's the queen.

King and queen!

Can I have the queen, Bluey?

Um... Sure.

Thanks!

Uh... You can't just...\
Oh, that's fine.

Are you sure you're happy\
with the king?

Yeah, I'm OK.

Don't worry, Bluey, the king's the\
most important piece on the board.

Is that right?

Yes.

And how many squares can he move?

Well, just one.

Just one square?!

That was a big square, wasn't it?!

Oh, I better rest my royal feeties.

They're a wittle tired.

Hey!\
Meanwhile...

..the queen moves as far\
as she wants, in any direction.

Hup-hup-hup.

Which is handy,\
'cause she has to do all the work.

Hup-hup-hup-hup!

Are you finished?

Yes.

Anyway... Hey, where's Bingo?

Ohh, it's a lovely day for a picnic.

Hey!

I thought the queen\
could go anywhere.

Bluey, have your turn.\
What do I do?

Just move a prawn. PAWN!

No, no, forward only.

That's it. My turn.

Hey!\
Oh, yep, your turn.

I'm moving Gallahop.

Clip-clop-clip-clop.

Uh... No, he can't go that far, mate,

and you can't\
move two pieces at once.

But Baldicus\
wants to visit Mr Shineyhead.

They're friends.

Well, no, they're actually enemies.

No, they're friends.

Their little prawn children\
go to kindy together.

OK, they're friends.

Now watch.\
This is how you take a piece.

Boop! See?

Gallahop!

It's OK.\
He just starts from back here.

Oh, phew.

No, he's dead.

Gallahop's dead?!

Of course he's not dead.

Oh, uh...yeah, no, he's not dead.

He's just out of the game.

Ohh!

I did say chess\
might be a bit old for you, Bingo.

You are going to pay, young man.

My turn! Right!

Where can I move?

Uh... Here or here.

Bang! There!

Yeah, OK, now, you see,

it's important\
to keep your pieces protected.

I can just take him like this.

Daughter of Gallahop!

Grr!

Yeah, I can just take him.

What about here?

Yeah, I'll take him again.

Stop it!

I'm just showing you the rules!

Get the queen out, Bluey!

Oh, yeah! Time for another picnic.

Hyah!

Can she do that?\
Yep.

But I have him protected.

Doink!

My queen!

Oh, no!

Really, Bandit?

Oh! And it was the king\
who did the honours.

Mum, how do you beat Dad?

It's easy, Bluey.

Here we go.\
I can beat him in four moves.

Ooh!

First I move this guy here.

Great start.

Doink!

Then I move him and ask Dad,

"Why do you want to teach the kids\
THIS game?"

And he answers,

"Because smart people play chess,

"and I want MY kids to be smart."

Next move I ask, "And WHY\
do you want your kids to be smart?"

That's a bad move.

And this is what he'll say -

"Right now\
you kids are little prawns.

"But one day you'll be queens,

"and I won't\
always be there to protect you,

"so you'll have\
to look after yourselves.

"But I'm going to do\
whatever I can now to help you."

Checkmate.

'Cause he's a good king.

And you're a good queen.

But a lousy chess player.

And you turned out fine.

Work on their heads later.

For now, just hearts.

Here, Bingo.

Ooh, welcome!

First things first.

You're not dead, OK?

You're at a pool party.

Yay.

Oh, no, I'm not doing anything

until one of these kids walks past\
here NOT like a complete fruitloop.

Bandit!

Look at that one! Ha!\
Boop, boop, boop.

These kids are nuts!

Well, I know where they get it from.

This episode of Bluey\
is called Housework.

You're really doing this?\
I think I have to.

(GROANS) OK, at least set the rules.

What will it take for you\
to get back to the housework?

Just, you know,\
one foot in front of the other.

I don't think\
that's too much to ask.

Ohh-ahh! Ohh-ahh!\
OK.

Ha! See?! That looks good.

Boom! Come on!\
Uh-uh - look at her arms.

They're following her legs.\
Really?

Yeah. They're meant to go the other\
way, the opposite of your legs.

Oh, yeah!

Ha! That's crazy!\
That's what I'm saying!

Sheets!

(SINGS) # Oh, sheets! #

OK, that's not even close\
to her normal walk.

Oh, hang on. Hang on. Here we go.

Feet OK. Arms OK.

I think we're good.

Ee... Ee!

Backwards!

BOTH: And there it is.

This is hard.

I'll even settle for the SAME\
crazy walk from there to there.

But look -

one...two...

..three different walks\
in three metres.

Why do they do it?!\
'Cause they're nuts!

(SINGS) # Row, row, row your boat

# Gently down the stream... #

That's not even a walk!

I'm making a cuppa.\
We're going to be here a while.

Boom!

Boom!

B-b-b-r-r-r-r-r!

Elephant.

Kangaroo.

Bawk-buk! Buk-buk-buk...\
What did I miss?

Buk-kawk!\
Chicken.

Working our way\
through the animal kingdom.

That's an emu.

Yeah. Or maybe an ostrich.

Or a big duck?

And that's some sort of, uh...

..um...

Ee-aww!

Donkey!

Some of these look really hard to do.

I know! Don't they get tired?

Bie-upp!

Bie-upp!

Bie-upp!

Whoa, we have a winner.

Holy-dooly.

That's impressive.

How do you even do that?

You have to, like,\
have your feet out like a duck...

Ow! But then pop them in...

While spinning.\
Oh, yeah, while spinning.

(GRUNTS) Ow! My groin!

(LAUGHS)\
That's funny, is it?

(LAUGHS) A little.\
Well, come on, you try it.

OK, so....feet out.

Yeah, but back in\
on every other step.

Yeah! See? And then you spin.

(GRUNTS) Agh!

Oh!\
Ooh!

(LAUGHS)\
See? It's not easy.

I can do this.

Yeah, you've got to bend.\
That's good.

How are my feet?\
Yeah, yeah, they're good, babe.

OK, here we go.

Spin!

Ohh! Oh, man! Dizzy.

(CHUCKLES)

Adup! Ad-adup!

Ooh!\
Adup!

Huh?

Oh, yeah, hang on.\
I think I've got it.

You've got to go, "Bie-upp!\
Bie-upp!" while you're doing it!

Bie-upp! Bie-upp!

You re not spinning!\
You've got to spin!

Oh, yeah. Ooh...

Bluey, look.\
Huh?

Bie-upp!\
Bie-upp!

What are they doing?

I don't know,\
but it doesn't look like housework.

Bie-upp!\
Bie-upp!

What's going on?

MUM AND DAD: Hey! Kids!

Uh... Shouldn't you\
be tidying the blankets up?

We finished.

Shouldn't YOU be doing housework?

We haven't started.\
Why?

We're trying to walk like you guys.

Why?

We don't know!\
Yeah!

Mm, OK.

Can you show us how you do\
the 'bie-upp, bie-upp' walk?

Yeah!

OK, you start with your feet out

and then they go in.

Out. In.

Out. In.

MUM AND DAD: Out. In.

Put your bottom out a bit more.

Yay, you got it!\
Out. In.

Dad, you need to do duck feet.\
Out. In.

Oh, yeah, I forgot.\
Out.

And you have to say, "Bie-upp!"

ALL: Bie-upp! Bie-upp!

MUM AND DAD: Bie-upp! Bie-upp!

Bie-upp! Bie-upp!\

Bie-upp! Bie-upp!\
Oh! So are you, Dad!

Bie-upp! Bie-upp!\
I'm doing it! Whoo-hoo!

(LAUGHS) You got it! You got it!\
Go, Dad!

MUM AND DAD:\
Bie-upp! Bie-upp! Bie-upp!

(SIGHS) The house is still a mess.

None of the vacuuming is done, but we\
can both now do the 'bie-upp' walk.

I think I'm OK with that.

Me too.

Well, we finished our chores,\
so we're going to play.

Go for it, girls. Well done.

Bye!

(WHISPERS) Bandit! Bandit! Look!

Huh? What?

Is that OK? Is that OK?

Arms swinging.\
One foot in front of the other.

Are we good? Are we good?\
Yeah, I think we're good!

BOTH: Yes!

Whoo-hoo! Yeah!\
Yes!

Grown-ups are nuts.\
(MUM AND DAD LAUGH)

BOTH: Ahh!

You know what that means.

Yeah, I know. Back to the housework.

Yep.

Let's just get through it.

Then we can relax.

Yeah. Too easy, Sheila.

Ready, kids?\
I'll just close my eyes.

Uh... Pat, no.\
You have to stop on each kid once.

What? Why?

So everyone gets a prize.

But how can EVERYONE get a prize?\
There's just one in the middle.

No, there's a prize in each layer.

What?!

So no-one misses out.

Eh, Bandit, are you hearing this?

Yeah. Where have you been, mate?

Start the music, Dad!

Look, when I was a kid,\
there was only one...

ALL: Start the music!\
OK! OK! I'll start!

But this is NOT\

Oh, man, I'm not cut out for this.

(BOTH SQUEAL)

Balloons are blown up, Janelle!

Thanks. I'm almost there\
with pass-the-parcel.

Oh, good-o.

Oh, hang on. Are you\
putting a present every layer?

Yeah, of course.\
No way!

I want to play it the proper way.

None of this\
present-every-layer business.

Put one big present in the middle.\
Winner gets that.

Well, what about everyone else?\
They have to suck it up.

That's not how it's done anymore,\
Pat.

I'm putting my foot down, Janelle.\
We're raising a nation of squibs.

Fine! But YOU'RE handling it!

No worries. You watch.\
This will blow their minds.

(INDISTINCT CHATTER)\
Ready for pass-the-parcel?

PUPS: Yeah!

We're gonna mix this up a bit, kids.\
You're gonna love it.

Go!

(MUSIC PLAYS)\
See now? I'm not looking.

I'm just going to push this button\
at any time.

(SQUEALS)\
PUPS: Yay, Bingo!

I can't find the present.

Uh... Yep, that's right.

Check under your legs.

Lucky's Dad, where's the present?

Uh... Now, you see? There isn't one.

There's just one big present\
in the middle.

BOTH: What?

Yeah, what?

We're playing it the proper way.

OK, let's go. Keep passing.\
(MUSIC RESUMES)

So, I don't get a present?

No, 'cause, just like in real life,\
you...

Come on, just keep passing.\

Mummy!

Wah!

This is how\
you're supposed to play it!

This isn't the '80s, Pat!

Uh... Janelle?

Don't look at me, mate.

(PUPS HOWL)

Oh, man!

Lucky's Dad, do I not win anything?

Oh! It's OK.

You won five bucks. Here.

And so did you.\
Everyone wins five bucks.

Wait, who can break a 20?

Actually, look - take one of these.

(SCREAMS) No! Dad!\
They're MY presents!

Give it back, Dad!\
You've got plenty.

You can give a few away!\
Oh, yeah!

Well, that was fun, wasn't it?

Yes. Except for pass-the-parcel.

I don't like Lucky's Dad's rules.

Yeah. It's hard when you don't win.

Yes, it is.

Maybe next time.

OK, that's kid number five...

Mum, where's my...\
Argh! Out! Out!

Why?

I'm wrapping pass-the-parcel\

Oh, can you do it Lucky's Dad's way?

With only one present in the middle?

Yeah, but as good as THIS one.

Honey, that was a bit of a disaster.

No, it was awesome. Please?!

Time for pass-the-parcel!\
(SPITS)

BOTH: Hooray!

OK, kids...and parents,

Jasper has asked

that we play pass-the-parcel\

It's OK. I don't mind.

Really?\
Yeah.

When Leila is happy, I'm happy.

Oh, Bingo.

Maybe next time.

You know what, Bingo?

I think you're getting quite good\
at losing.

Bluey, how do you want\
to do pass-the-parcel tomorrow?

Um... I'll let Bingo choose.

Really? Thanks, Bluey.

Which way do you want to play, Bingo?

Hmm...

OK, ready for pass-the-parcel?

ALL: Yeah!

I think it's only fitting\
to let Lucky's Dad do the honours.

(CHEERING)

Oh, righto! Good on youse.

Which rules are we playing, Bluey?

I left it up to Bingo to choose.

Did you choose Lucky's Dad's rules?

You'll see!

Well, Bingo,\
whatever way is OK with me.

What happened\
to raising a nation of squibs?

Oh, look, let them have some fun.

Let's get a bit rocking, eh?!

We've got no satnav!

Oh, dear.

This is bad. I don't know the way\

Why not?

Well, I've only been there twice, and\
I just put on satnav and zone out.

Oh, man. I don't know\

Hi!\
Hola!

I'm trying to find my son's school.

You don't know\

It's because he just puts satnav on\

Yeah, well,\
I'm not from around here, so...

Neither are we. I'm from Argentina.

And I'm from France.

Rightio.\
Well, can I borrow your phone?

Oh, yeah. Here.

Ah! Thank you.\
But there's no reception.

Oh, man.

Would you like a strawberry?

Yes, please!

Great.

Do you have a phone charger?

I don't have a phone.

What? Why not?

Oh, I had one,\
but people just kept ringing it.

Oh, man.

I'm looking for my son's school.

You don't know the way\

He just puts satnav on and...\
Lulu.

It's the Glasshouse Primary School.

Oh, you're a long way from THAT.

Oh, man!

I could draw you a map if you want.

Oh, yes! A map!

It'll cost you, though.

Oh. Uh... How much?

One of those strawberries.

(GIGGLES)

OK, so you just keep following\
that road and you're there. Whoo!

Great. How long will that take?

Ah, ages.

But what?

Well, it's a bit of a bush road,

and you look like a bit of a...

Go on.

Look, mate,\
just show me the shortcut.

OK!

There's an old dirt road just here.

Dad doesn't like\
the car to get dirty.

Lulu!

Oh, you're going to get dirty.

No...more...supplies.

And I've got no idea if we're\
heading in the right direction.

And the deck could use a good scrub.

Oh, here it is. This is the shortcut.

What does the sign say?

It says the road is only for cars\
that are four-wheel drives.

Is our car a four-wheel drives?

No. It's an all-wheel drives.

Oh.

How many wheels have we got?

Four.

Lulu, hold onto your strawberries.

Agh!\
We're coming, Jack!

Yeah. You can order\
a pizza or a burrito.

A burri-no?

BOTH: (GIGGLE) Burri-TO!

You can have anything you want.

Oh. OK.

Anything I want, eh?

Uh...

That makes it harder,\
for some reason.

Oop. Oh, sorry guys.

Better pay for that. Boop!

Do you need help choosing, Grandad?

No, no, I'm alright.

Oh, I know! Boop!

Curried sausages!

Sorry.

Boop!

Did I do it right?

Yeah! Good one, Grandad!

No worries!

Let's have some food.

Ooh, that's good.

So, do I just eat here alone?

You can watch TV on your phone\

Yeah! There's a TV app.

OK. Boop!

(CRICKETS CHIRP)

Are you sure\
we're playing this right?

Yeah!

OK!

Hey, uh...can ANYONE\
make one of these apps?

Um... Yeah.

And they can do whatever you want?

Yeah.\
Good to know.

I'm just borrowing this.

Well, can you please\
catch this croc?!

You don't want a croc\

Now what?!

You! Grab him by the snout!\
Me? What about you?

I'll be back here supervising.

OK, hold still, Bingo!

Ohh! Got it!\

NOW what do you do?!

What are you asking ME for?\
YOU'RE the croc catcher!

Well, I'm still working on the app.

Grandad!\
OK, OK.

DON'T have any pets?

Eda-whaty what?\
Edamame beans.

They're from the sushi train. Pop.

Super!

I need you to get\
one piece of pavlova.

Pav-lova?\

IN the fridge.

See?\
Aha! Pavlova.

Yes, pavlova.

Give to customer.\
Bonjour.

You're outta here.

Oh, bonjour?\
Out!

Oh, bonjour!\
Un champ pour deux poissons!

I know exactly what\
he was trying to do.

He was trying to stop YOU\

I like his funny talk.

Well, he can funny talk\
somewhere else.

I've got a cafe to run.

Now, let me sort out that pavlova.

Bonjour.

Psst! Bluey!\
Yeah?

# Ou est la discotheque? #

Hey! You can't open a cafe\
right next to mine!

Bonjour.

Where are you going?

I just want to see the menu.

Well, don't be long.\
Your pavlova's coming.

Au revoir.

Can I see a menu, please?\
Mercredi.

What's it got on it?

It's only got endabale beans.

Ha! Well, she doesn't want them.\
She wants pavlova.

Oh-ho! No-ho-ho.

Mmm. Uh-huh. Oh, ouais.\

to make them taste nice.

Oh, bonjour.

Um...it's just that\
I really think I want pavlova.

Aw. Tres bon.

Well...

..you can make me some\
endomame beans, if you want.

Tres malade!

But I get to choose if I want\
to eat THEM or the pavlova.

Hmm.

It's just I don't like it\
when you MAKE me eat something.

Mon petit choux a la creme.

It's a cafe competition!

I'm gonna get the sprinkles.

he knows what he's doing.

Oh! Je suis un chien!\
Dad just called me a booger!

Yum.

What is THIS, Muffin?!

It's an electric car.

My dad bought a new car,\

It drives without pedals!

Yes. And it's very expensive,\
Muffin, so be careful with it.

Can we play Pizza Girls in it?

OK!\
BLUEY AND BINGO: Hooray!

OK, we're all sisters\

Got it.\
Hmm...

There's no roof\

It's a conbertible.

Oh, cool.

Customers!

The phone's not working.

I'll just ask them.

Hey, Muffin, no!

We're meant to do it over the phone.

They want a supreme.

OK, one supreme, thanks,\

Our mum started this pizza shop.

She worked really hard, so\
we're trying to give her a holiday.

Wow, we're going to deliver pizzas\
fast now.

Argh! Stop!

I'm just putting the pizza in.

You can't bring mud in the new car!

What? Why?

Because it's very expensive.

Oh, OK. Well, what do we do?

We have to play something else.

we don't tell you to do things\
just to be mean.

It's for your own good. You don't\
want to live like an animal.

We can live however we want.\
We've got Tina.

Hey! Shoo, fly! Get away!

Why are there so many flies around?!

Because you rolled onto\
a jam sandwich half an hour ago.

Oh. Where's the other half?

You need a bath!\
Never!

Ohh! Flies!

Argh!\
Bingo, get back here!

Tina, help!

Whoa! (GRUNTS)\
(GIGGLES)

Tina! Get off!

What happened?!

I went to the toilet and\
Mum tried to make me wash my hands!

Eugh! Bingo!\
You didn't wash your hands?!

Nope. Hey, what?! Get away!

Oh, there's the other half.

Eugh!

Don't touch me!\
You've got toilet hands!

BOTH: Argh! Get away, flies!

Get off me, Tina!

It's now or never, Bandit.

Get off!\
Hey, Tina.

Boom!

I've got her! I've got her!\
Hold her down!

Hey! Let go of Tina!

Get her legs!\
I'm trying!

She kicks like a mule!

Shoo! Argh! Get them!\
Use your toilet hands!

Toilet hands.

Argh! Get out, you little grub!

Ohh! Why does Tina stink so bad?

Quick, let's get her outside!

Argh!

(GROANS)\
She weighs a tonne!

She's a lot of woman!

Get her in the car!

(GRUNTS)

(GROANS)

(BOTH GRUNT)

You didn't see anything.

(WHIMPERS)

Tina! Use your karate!

Argh! You're on your own!

(PANTS)

No! Uh... Tina, come on,\
let's just talk about this.

Get him, Tina!

Argh!

Hey! Easy, easy.

Ohh! Tapping out. Tapping out!

OK, OK, we give up.

You win.\
BLUEY AND BINGO: Hooray!

High five!

Eugh! Bingo!

Ohh, Tina! I'm sorry, but you stink!

Yeah. When was the last time\
she had a bath?

Tina's never had a bath.\
And WE'RE not having a bath either.

Ohh! Shoo!

Hey, whoa, wait.\
Whose tooth is this?

It's huge!\
Is this Tina's?!

Yeah, it is.

And look - here's another one.

Why did her teeth fall out?

Well, when was the last time\
she brushed them?

Tina doesn't brush her teeth.

Ohh!\
Eugh!

Well, that's why\
her teeth are falling out.

Oh.

Kids, when we tell you

you have to have a bath or\
brush your teeth or wash your hands,

it's because there's a good reason\
to do all those things.

But, when we asked Dad why,\
he just says, "Because I said so."

Yeah, he says we have to\
because he's bigger than us.

Oh, really?

Maybe I should just give them\
three seconds?

Oh, yeah.

Look, we'll probably still\
say those things because we're busy,

but now you know\
what we really mean.

OK, Mum.\
Bring it in.

Toilet hands.

(BLUEY AND MUM SCREAM)\
(GIGGLES)

Tina, I think\
you can let go of me now.

Oh, yeah. It's all good now, Tina.

(GROANS)

Ohh!

No hard feelings, love.

Ow! Jeez!

She's got a handshake on her!

Argh!\
(OTHERS GIGGLE)

This is called 'shampoo', Tina.

It makes your hair\
smell like coconuts.

So then you go round and round\
and up and down

and don't forget the back ones!

And make sure\
you clean your teeth, Bluey.

(CLEARS THROAT)

Uh... I mean Bluey the Awesome.

Right away!

They're on the phone to Muffin.

Oh, happy New Year's.

Yeah! I do not have the energy\
for games today.

BLUEY: This way, customer.\
Oh, man.

This will be the most amazing trip\
you've ever been on.

Or I get my money back.

On you get! Watch your step!\
Ohh! Hey!

Ow! What's going on?!

Oh, yeah, Dad, can you be our boat?

Oh, can't your mum do it?\
Hey!

YOU'RE already on the floor!

Sorry, I haven't got it in me today.

Are you sick?\
Uh... No.

Just, um...uh...

Sleepy.\
Yeah, sleepy.

We went to bed a bit late last night.

Because you went\
to the New Near's party at Muffin's.

She saw you dancing\
on her barbecue table.

What?!\
Why wasn't she asleep!

She woke up when Uncle Stripe\
yelled, "Cannonball!"

and jumped into the pool.

Ha. Classic Stripe.

Please can you be our boat!

Ohh. Chilli?

You make a much better boat than me.

Argh, fine. ONE boat game,\
then you kids play by yourselves.

BLUEY AND BINGO: Hooray!\
Enjoy!

Oh, and, Mum,\
you're going to be the whale.

What?!\
(LAUGHS)

This episode of Bluey\
is called Whale Watching.

Wait, you have to pay me money\
for a ticket.

Oh, yes. Here you go.\
Thank you!

Here's your ticket.\
Ooh!

Now, if you aren't happy\
with your whale-watching trip,

I'll give you your money back.

Lovely.\
But that won't happen.

This will be the best whale-watching\
tour you've ever been on.

I don't know about that, kid.

All aboard!

Oh, Bluey, that's too loud.

(CHUCKLES) Off we go!

Yay!

It's a lovely day to go boat riding.

The sea is nice and calm.

Yeah, it's smooth sailing today.

Oh, no! We've hit rough seas!

What?\
Hold on, customer!

Here comes a big wave!

Argh!

Dad, we hit rough seas.

No, we hit smooth seas.

And, oh, look - we're at the whales!

Uh... No, you're not.\
The whales are ages away.

And point of fact - the boat\
doesn't decide about rough seas.

The boat DRIVER does.\
Yeah!

Uh... Point of fact -\
whales can't talk.

Second point of fact -\
today there are no rough seas.

Well, I'm going to find\
some rough seas.

Argh! The tail sail!\
Here we are - rough seas.

BOTH: Argh!

Nope.

Well, I'm just going to sail around\
till I find them!

Ohh! OK, fine.\
Hold on to your breakfast.

Here we go. Hold on, customer!

Whoa!\
(SQUEALS)

We are sorry, customer,

we have seemed to accidently

wandered into some rough seas.

Accidentally?! Argh!\
(GIGGLES)

Please don't go to the lavatory\
before the storm is over.

Hup! Storm's over.\
And look - we're at the whales.

Watch out! Snappy turtles!

Oh, Yeah! Snappy turtles!

Oh, for... Alright.

Snap! Snap! Snap! Snap! Snap!

Ow! Hey!

Oh, snap!

(SQUEALS)\
Argh!

(GROANS)\
(GIGGLES)

Phew!

And now we're at the...

Tidal wave!

Oh, man.

BLUEY AND BINGO: Agh!

Ohh!

Boosh!

Ohh. Man.

Are you OK, customer?\
Yes, I'm fine.

You don't want your money back?\
No, this is fun!

But are we almost at the whales?

BLUEY AND DAD: Yes!\
No.

Look over there!

(GASPS)

A whale!

(MOANS)

Weak!

The whale isn't doing much.

Yeah, come on, Whaley.

Ohh. Alright.

(MOANS)

Ooh-ooh-ooh.

The old girl's\
not very lively today.

Maybe let's try feeding it.

Oh, yeah. That might help, actually.

What do whales eat?

Something very healthy and green.

Usually, but today\
this one wants corn chips.

Oh, OK. I'll be right back.

Ooh, and some sour cream.

You got it!

Good move.

(CRUNCHES)

Mmm!

Wow.

Whales eat a lot.

They can eat up to five bags a day.

These...are very bad for you.

OK, kids? Only whales...

(POPS DRINK CAN)

..should eat these.

(GLUGS) Ohh!

So good.

OK, here we go.\
The whale's been fed now.

Get your camera ready, passenger.

You're going to see the whale jump.

Jump?! Oh, man.

Whoo... (GRUNTS)

Ohh.

Don't whales\
usually jump OUT of the water?

Yeah, that's not gonna happen today.

BLUEY AND BINGO: Oh, what?!\
Yeah, what?!

Sorry!

So, this boat's\
gone through a huge storm,

braved rough seas,\
a tidal wave AND snappy turtles

to see a whale\
who lies there eating corn chips?!

It would seem so.

Well, I guess we'll sail\
back home now.

Ohh.

Oh, kids, look, um...

..how about I put a show\
about whales on the TV?

BLUEY AND BINGO: Yeah! TV!

It's got to be done.\
Oh, no argument here.

Um... OK, customer, I'm sorry\
the whale trip was no good.

Here's your money back.\
Thanks!

We're going to watch TV now.

What? On me?

NARRATOR: Whales travel\
extremely long distances

into warm waters\
to have their babies.

Aww, so cute!

They stay with them all the way back

to the colder waters.

Gee. Those whales sure are good mums.

You can't help but admire\
that motherly bond.

Dad, we can't hear the TV.

There's nothing a whale mum\
wouldn't do for her children.

(SPLASHES)

(SPLASHES)\
Ooh!

That whale's more jumpy\
than the one WE saw.

They teach their young how to...

BOTH: Huh?

(MOANS SLOWLY)

BLUEY AND BINGO: Whoa!

Ooh-ohh-ooh...

Argh!

(BLUEY AND BINGO GIGGLE)\
The whale landed on the boat!

Abandon ship!

This way, customer.

(CHUCKLES) That was amazing!

Here's my money back!

Oh, are you sure?

We'll have to live\
on this desert island.

Oh, wow! OK!

Wait, you're going to live there\
all by yourselves?

Yeah!

So, you don't need\
the whale or the boat anymore?

No, I've had enough\
whales and boats, thank you.

Ooh, a coconut.\

Ahh! Smooth seas.

Hey! What's going on?

Dad blew off right in my face!

I did not.

Ohh! Bandit, that's a new low!

I didn't do it!\
Why doesn't anyone believe me?

Because you're the king of fluffies.

I know how to settle this.

BOTH: Oh.

This episode of Bluey\

Time to pay, fluffer king.

Sorry, I just had\
to put my curlers in.

(KNOCKS TABLE) Alright!

Three rules -

one person talks at a time,

everyone says 'fluffy' when talking\
about Dad's...fluffy...

ALLEGED fluffy.

..and, most importantly,\
everyone tells the truth.

Yes, you.

Do we say "Dad fluffied"\
or "Dad fluffed"?

Allegedly.

Either.

What about,\
"He was baking brownies"?

Allegedly!\
(KNOCKS TABLE) Enough!

What does 'allegebly' mean?

It means you both\
get to tell your side of the story

and then I decide\
who's telling the truth.

OK?\
Yes, Your Honour.

Ooh, I like THAT.

Fourth rule -\
everyone calls me Your Honour.

OK, Bluey, you first.

Yes, Your Honour.

It all happened this morning.

Mum, this is you asleep.

This is me.

And where was Dad?

(LAUGHS)

Here!\
Hey! Your Honour!

I'll allow it.

So, I was just here, um...\
doing something,

and Dad got out of bed, turned

and fluffied right in my face!

Brrp!

(MOCK-COUGHS)

Well, I've heard enough.\
Hey, hang on!

Oh, yeah, YOUR side. Make it quick.

Here, give them here. Check it.

Mum was here sleeping,\
looking gorgeous as usual.

Oh, well... (GIGGLES)

Hey!

You're trying\
to make Mum like you more!

I got up, went downstairs

and got embroiled in this mess.

Hey!\
What?

You missed the bit\
where you fluffied.

Allegebly.

It just doesn't sound\
like the sort of thing I'd do.

OTHERS: Oh! Yes, it does!

What?!

Hey, Bingo, pull my finger.\
OK.

CHILLI AND BLUEY: Bingo, no!

Well, fair enough.

But on the morning of THIS morning,\
I did NOT bake a brownie.

Ooh! I've got an idea.

(CLEARS THROAT) Is this what\
you had for breakfast yesterday?

Baked beans on wheat toast?

Yep.

Bingo, what's the fluffy level\
on this?

Doo-doo-doop. High.

Thank you.

And then what\
did you have for lunch, Mr Heeler?

Uh... Just some, um...sauerkraut.

Excuse me?

Sauerkraut.\
Bingo, fluffy level?

Doo-doo-doo-doop.

Now, we had dinner at Indie's house,\
didn't we?

Yep.

Can you tell us what you ate?

Uh... I'm not sure I ate much.

Mr Heeler!\
OK.

I had a vegan nut roast.

Oh, dear.

Anything else?

Uh... Nothing comes to mind.

Really? Nothing from\
the petrol station on the way home?

That might have come in this tray?!

(GASPS)

Oh, well, maybe I had a pie.

Oh, Bandit.

Well, all I'd had was nut roast!

Bingo, where\
is the fluffy meter now?

Boo-loo-doo-doop. At the top.

Sounds like you were ready to blow.

My food choices are not on trial!

(KNOCKS)

Bingo, on the morning\
of this morning,

did you see Dad fluffy in my face?

Yes, I did.

Oh, what?!\
Bingo, you weren't even there!

(GIGGLES) Yes, I was!

Thank you, Bingo. You can leave.

(WHISPERS) Here's your lollipop.

(SQUEALS)\
Hey! Your Honour!

Bingo, are you fibbing\
to get a lollipop?

Yes. (GIGGLES)

Give me that.\
Ohh.

Everyone forget that bit. Bluey,\
that has not helped your case.

Remember -\
the truth will set you free.

OK, Mum.

(CLEARS THROAT)

I would like to call on...

..Mum!

(BLUEY AND BINGO GASP)\
Me?!

Mrs Heeler,

on the morning of this morning,

you didn't hear me fluffy, did you?

No.

Let's repeat that.\
You didn't hear me fluffy.

'Cause she was asleep!

Yeah. Well,\
I wasn't asleep, I was dozing.

I mean, I heard you get up\
and move the bedside table.

What?\
Oh, really?

Tell me about this bedside table.

Um... No further questions, Your\
Honour. You can go now. Come on, get.

Well, Dad charges the tablet\
on his bedside table at night,

and sometimes\
he knocks it off when he gets up

and he has to move the table\
to get it.

And it makes this horrible\
scraping sound, like...

(GROANS)

Oh, no.

He didn't move the table!\
That sound was the fluffy!

Argh!\
Bandit!

Well, maybe we should hear\
from, uh...that guy!

ALL: What guy?\
Argh!

BOTH: (YELP) He's running away!\
Get him, kids!

You'll never get me alive!

(GRUNTS)

(BOTH GIGGLE)

Argh!

Freedom!

(BOTH GIGGLE)

(GRUNTS, LAUGHS) Get off me!

(BOTH GIGGLE)\
Get! (LAUGHS)

(KNOCKS)

Is there something\
you'd like to say?

Whoever smelt it dealt it?

Mr Heeler!

OK, OK! I fluffied.

In your child's face.

Her face is at bum level.\
It's hard NOT to.

Well, I seem to manage.

Oh, like you don't bake\
the odd brownie.

Bandit!

That could\
have been me!

(KNOCKS) I sentence you to one hour\
of playing horsey ride

with the defendant and her sister.

BLUEY AND BINGO: Hooray!

See, Bluey?\
The truth will set you free.

Well, let's test that out, shall we?

I have one last question.

OK.

The truth is gonna set someone free.

Bluey, what were you DOING at bum\
level on the morning of this morning?

Oh!

Uh...

Bluey?

OK. I was playing computer games\
on the tablet.

(GASPS)

Even though Mum said

you weren't allowed to play\
computer games until the weekend?

(GIGGLES) Yes.

Bluey Christine Heeler!

(KNOCKS) I sentence BOTH of you\
to horsey rides!

Saddle up, Bingo.

Hooray!\
Hey!

(GIGGLES)

I'm sorry, Dad.

I'm sorry, Bluey.

(KNOCKS) OK, family meeting over.\
Everyone out.

Huh?\
Come on, quickly.

Why do we have to leave so fast?\
Yeah, what's the hurry?

Come on. Out!\
Hang on.

Out! Out! Come on!

Yes, I can! Now, where do I hide?

Under a bed!\
OK!

Don't help her, Bingo.\
Why not?

Because she's not meant\
to be running away.

She's meant to be in time-out\
for hogging.

Hey! That's my ukulele!

You lended it to me.

Yeah, but that was ages ago.

I'm still playing with it.

Muffin, you hang that phone up now,\

No!

OK, well, I'm ending\

What? Since when?

I read a blog.\
You didn't tell ME.

Because you're never here.\
Hey, uh...guys...

Just let me handle it, Stripe.\
No, Trix, let ME handle it.

I get to parent too.

Yeah, but you have to do it right.

This is how I do it.

Guys!

Kids, can you switch this off?

Oh! But we're doing drawing things!

Alright. Well, can you mute it?\
Yeah, we can.

I feel like\

Oh! They're working together!

Muffin! Come back here!

What couch?!\

We've got lots of couches!

It's that couch right there!

is called Ragdoll.

Dad, come on!

We don't want to play Ragdoll.\
We just want ice-cream.

Sounds good. I just need some help\
getting to the car.

Agh. Mum!

Your mum's at work.\
Earning monies.

It's not THAT far to the car.\
We just need to pull him.

OK. I'll push from this side.

Ready? Go!

(BOTH GRUNT)

He moved!\
Hooray!

Now pull on that leg,\
I'll push his bum.

I wonder what flavour ice-cream\
I'll get.

It's working!\
It's very slow, though.

Let's try rolling him.\
OK.

Maybe choc chip. Mmm! Chop mint?

Ready, set, go!

Bubblegum. Salted caramel.\
(BOTH GRUNT)

No, wait! Pistachio!

Definitely pistachio.

Hurry up, kids! I want an ice-cream!

BOTH: We're going as fast as we can!

(ALL GRUNT)

Oop! Square peg in a round hole.

Ooh. I know.

Argh. Dad! This is too hard!

Obstacles do not BLOCK the path.\
They ARE the path.

I don't understand\
what you're saying!

Bluey, you lift him up that way!

Argh. OK.

(BOTH GROAN)

This is hard work!

A bit of hard work\
never hurt anyone.

Argh!\
Ooh!

OK. That actually did hurt.

Come on, Bingo!

That's it, kids. If you get knocked\
down seven times, you get up eight!

There's no I in 'team'!

Dad, stop talking!

Bluey, look!

Oh, yeah! This will be easy.

What will be easy?

Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! Ohh!

Obstacles... Ohh!

..are placed... Ooh!

..in our way... (GRUNTS)

..to see if what we want... Ow!

..is really worth... (GRUNTS)

..fighting for!

BOTH: Whoo! Go, Dad!

Ooh! Ooh! Ooh!\
(BOTH GIGGLE)

Help me get him around the corner.

(BOTH GROAN)

He's stuck!

Even if we get him out of the house,

we still have to get him all the way\
across the yard to the car.

It's impossible!

Great works are performed not by\
great strength but by perseverance.

Hang on! Are you trying\
to teach us something?

One must persevere...

Ohh! He IS!

What?!\
OK!

Yes, I'm trying to teach you\
the value of hard work.

Why do you keep trying to teach us\
things that we don't want to learn?!

Because I don't want\
you growing up to be lazy.

(GROANS) That's it.\
We're not going any further.

What, you don't want ice-cream?

No. You can keep your monies.

OK.

Bluey?

Yes?

I DO want an ice-cream.\
Me too.

Right, come on, we're getting\
this big blue guy into the car.

DAD AND BINGO: Hooray!

But we're not learning anything.

Got it?\
Got it.

But do yourself a favour - don't\
work HARD if you can work SMART.

Mm!

Ready, Bingo?!

Ready!

(BOTH GRUNT)\
Ow!

Ooh! (GROANS)\
BOTH: Yeah!

This is easy!

Ooh! Ohh!

There's the car!\
Hooray!

Let's skateboard him\
down the stairs!

What?! No, do not skateboard me\
down those stairs.

OK, fine.

(SINGS) # Where the bullfrog\
jumps from... #

Argh! Ooh! Ooh!\
Oh, my goodness!

BLUEY AND BINGO: Hooray!\
Morning, Wendy!

What's going on?! Are you OK?

He stole our monies!

What?!

Oh, that's putting\
a bit of a slant on it.

He said he'll only give it back if\
we carry him all the way to the car.

Is that right?

Just keep walking, Wendy.\
This doesn't concern you.

It does now. Come on, girls.

Hey, Wendy, watch the hands.

(ALL GRUNT)

Bossing around young children!

(ALL GRUNT)

Honestly!\
Hey, hey, hey! Watch the prickles.

Ow!\
Argh!

We'll never lift him\
into the car seat! He's too heavy!

Ah, well, what're you gonna do?

Get the door, girls. I'll show you\
what 10 years of Pilates can do.

Hey, hey, Wendy, what are you doing?!

Pay attention, girls. Ready?

Engage the core. Straight back.

Ready, Wendy? And... (GROANS)

Look at those quads!

BLUEY AND BINGO: Wow!

Promise me you'll work hard\
to maintain a strong core, girls.

Don't get lazy!

BOTH: Yes, Wendy! We won't!

(GROANS, GRUNTS)

BOTH: Yeah!

Now we can have ice-cream!

(HONKS HORN)\
Ooh!

I'm not sure I should be driving\
in this condition.

BOTH: What?!

So we don't get ice-cream?

Not unless you can drive... Ooh!

Strap yourselves in, kids.

I'LL drive you to the shops.

BOTH: Hooray!

WENDY AND BLUEY AND BINGO: # Down\
by the banks of the Hanky Panky

# Where the bullfrogs jump\
from bank to banky with a hip... #

Here you go, my darlings.

BOTH: Thanks, Wendy!

"Thanks, WENDY"?! I paid for them!

Oh, yes. Here's your change.\
Hey!

(BOTH GIGGLE)

OK, Bluey, take a lick.

(BRIGHT MUSIC PLAYS)

Whoa.

This is the best ice-cream\
I've ever tasted.

Ha! I told you!

Monies!

So, Hansel and Gretel returned home\
and lived happily ever after.

Wow, that was a wild ride.

Yeah!\
Are fairytales true or not true?

Well, what do you mean by true?

I mean, did they happen\
for real life?

Well, no.\
Phew!

But they've got true things in them.\
Like what?

Like, you know, it's not good\
to be greedy and stuff.

And, if you're brave and honest,\
things will work out.

Oh, yeah.

Hey, do you want to hear a fairytale\
that IS true?

BOTH: Yes, please!

It's about a mean brother\
who ends up good,

and it's got a curse in it\
and even a princess!

Wow!

And it happened for real life?

Yep. You know how I know?

BOTH: How?\
Because it happened to ME.

BOTH: Ooh!

This episode of Bluey\
is called Fairytale.

This story is set\
a long, long time ago

in a place called the '80s.

That's me when I was 10 years old

on holiday\
with your Uncle Rad and Uncle Stripe.

Hang on, where's your helmet?

This was the '80s, man.\
There WERE no helmets.

It was a wild place.

Trampolines had no nets.

Argh!

Your mum wrote your name\
on everything.

BMX seats were high.

Music was on cassettes.

And skids were big.

(SKIDS)\
Whoa! Good skid, Rad!

(SQUEAKS)

You can't skid, Stripe!

Yes, I can.

No, you can't. And Mum wants you.

Huh?\
Made you look, you dirty chook!

Ha-ha! Suffer!

(BOTH GASP)

You're teasing Stripe!

'Fraid so.

But that's mean!

I told you - this fairytale's\
about a mean brother - me.

(BOTH GASP)

But don't worry.\
I was about to learn my lesson.

Bandit, stop teasing Stripe.

Make me.

Hey, Stripe, your wheels are turning!

Huh? Argh!

(CRASHES)\
Ha-ha! Made you look, you dirty...

BOTH: Chook!\
Jinx!

(TAPE WHIRRS)

Huh?\
What's 'jinx'?

OK, in the '80s,

if two people said the exact same\
word at the exact same time, like...

BOTH: Chook!

..one of you would yell out 'jinx'...

Jinx!

..which meant you had 10 seconds\
to touch them.

One!

Two!

Three!

Four!

Five.\
Hua!

Six!

Seven!

Eight!

If you didn't touch them\
in that 10 seconds...

10!

..they'd say...\
Skint!

..and then\
you could never speak again.

(BOTH GASP)

What? You can never speak\
forever and ever?

Nope. You were cursed.

Wow!

The only thing\
that could break the curse

was if someone said your name.

Do you want me to say your name?

OK.

Ban...didums! Ha!

Can YOU just say your own name?

Nope, you're not allowed to speak.

What happens if you DO speak?

Oh...well...look, I shouldn't\
tell you, but...

(WHISPERS INDISTINCTLY)\
BOTH: What?!

That's terrible!

I told you -\
the '80s was a wild place.

Anyway, being cursed was not\
a lot of fun when you're on holiday.

Kids, do you want your fish\
battered or crumbled?

Battered!\
Battered!

What about you? Come on, speak up.

He wants crumbed.\
OK.

He LOVES crumbed.

Don't you, ban...dishwasher. Ha!

Eugh!

I hated crumbed.

Who ate all the mini cereals?!

STRIPE AND RAD: He did!\
Right, you, get over here!

(BOTH LAUGH)

Gee, Nana was a bit mean.

Yeah, it was the '80s.\
Mums were allowed to be mean.

And dads weren't much help either.

Let's see who can shout the loudest.\
OK.

(BOTH SCREAM)

Kids, keep it down!

(SCREAMING CONTINUES)

What do you want, Stripe...uh...\
Rad...uh...Gerald...

Agh! Whatever your name is!

What are you on about?\
What's he on about?

Rad jinxed him. He can't talk\
until someone says his name.

Ah, right.

So, you want me to say your name\
so you can talk again.

Well, you're dreaming, mate.

You know what I call this?\
I call it a good start.

How do I jinx it\
so NONE of you can talk?

BOTH: Dad!

Is it like this?\
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh!

I was never going to talk again.

No-one was going to say my name.

I'm not going to say your name.

I think this will do you some good.

All holiday you've been mean\
to your little brother.

You can't tick-tack, Stripe!

It's my turn now.

No, it isn't!

Ha-ha! Nice stack!

This is a chance for you\
to have a good think about it.

Nana was right.\
Not about her perm, but about me.

I hadn't been\
a very good brother to Stripe.

I deserved to be cursed.

So, when did the curse get broken?

The very next morning, actually.

I was on my way to the shower block\
to clean my teeth.

By yourself?!

It was the '80s!

STRIPE: Mum! Ow!

Stripe had taken a shortcut\
to the toilets

and got stuck in the prickles.

Help!

(GASPS) So, you could tell him\
you won't help him

unless he says your name!

Oh, yeah!

You're right. I could have done that.

So, did you?

No, I just helped him.

Thanks.

Ban...dina!

Ha-ha!\
BLUEY AND BINGO: What?!

You helped him and\
even THEN he didn't say your name?!

(CHUCKLES) That's brothers, kid.

To tell you the truth,

I was proud of him.

But then...who broke the curse?

Well, remember I said\
this fairytale has a princess?

GIRL: Bandit Heeler.

Is this your hat?

Is that...\
Mum?

That's Mum.\
BOTH: What?!

Don't listen to him. It wasn't me.

Don't listen to HER. It was.

Well, look, it MIGHT have been.

We did used to go on holidays\
to that caravan park.

Case closed!

But I've got no memory\
of that happening.

Oh! It's like a dagger in my heart.

How did she know your name?

It was written on my hat!

Wow!

Either way, it's a good story.

But is it true or not true?\
I need to know.

Well, I guess YOU have to decide.

Do you believe in fairytales?

Here you go.\
Thanks.

See you later.

Yeah.

See you later.
