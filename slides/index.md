# Research Methodology
<!-- _class: dark -->

<!--
Oksana is her presentation did a very good job explaining source-mining!
I did something similar for my process, but much more intellectually lazy.
More or less, I got uh, our textbook Galloway and Rose
There's a lot of good resources out there for finding speech samples.

Uhm, one thing I did in the process was, while I was trying to find speech samples, was, I downloaded all the subtitles from every episode of the show Bluey, which is an Australian kids show about a cartoon dog, and I put that in a text file, so I could search through it and find pronunciations. That's my personal contribution to the field of corpus linguistics.
-->

1. Started on Wikipedia, YouTube, Google
2. Source-mined for better explanatory sources. Routledge Handbook
3. Searched on IDEA, Wiktionary for speech samples

# **Varieties** of Australian English
<!-- _class: dark lead -->
(part two)


## **Broad, General, Cultivated** Accents
<!--
Australian is *very* homogenous.
Linguists recognize three main varieties of Australian accent, these are Broad, General, and Cultivated.
-->
"[The 3 Australian Accents](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZnioDeQNlxQ)" by Aussie English on YouTube.

Australian accents are **non-regional** and exist on a continuum. Instead, mostly class-based.

- **Broad Australian English** ("Strine" / "Ocker") <!-- Broad Austrlaian English is  -->
  - Most commmonly stereotyped, considered less educated/lower class/rural.
- **General Australian English**  <!-- hugh jackman actor -->
  - Most common dialect, particularly in urban areas. Often considered "Standard".
- **Cultivated Australian English**
  - More similar to RP, higher class.
  - Considered prestigious, less so in the present day.

# **Origins** of English in Australia
<!-- _class: lead dark -->
(part three)

## Early European **Exploration of Australia**
<!-- Note to self: speed thru this. -->

<!-- So European contact with Australia begins around the 16th century. -->
- 1559 – Mercator postulates a continental counterweight, "terra australis". <!-- In 1559 the Flemish geographer Gerardus Mercator, looks at the world map and says, well, we know the earth is round, and there's *all* this land up here on the top bit... therefore to counterbalance it, there must be a huge landmass somewhere on the bottom. He was wrong, this isn't how gravity works, but he was also right there being land here. They call this undiscovered continent "terra australis", Southern Land. -->
- 1606 – Dutch explorers <!-- The Dutch navigator Willem Jansz (show) is the first European to actually go to this continent. He sails around Papa New Guinea and claims this little top bit. The Dutch find this terra australis, and they name this newly discovered continent... any guesses? New Holland! Australia catches on a few cenrturies later. -->
- 1770 – Captain James Cook charts the east coast and claims it for Britain. <!-- For the two-ish centuries, a couple of Dutch, Spanish, and English navigators go to Australia, including Captain Cook of the British royal navy. They all land there and they look around and go, eh, kinda swampy, big spiders, the people who are already live here don't like me, we're good. -->

## **(The) English** in Australia
<!--
Untilllllll..... 1783, Britain has just lost their very lucrative colonies in America. They look at the world map and think, where else have colonies?
January 26, 1788, which is Australia Day – The First Fleet (consisting of 1500 setllers, half of them convicts) lands, British establishes a new penal colony in New South Wales. Basically, you have a lot of convicts, you ship em overseas and make them grow wheat and wool and you make money. It's *kind* of like slavery? Over the next 40 years the population of New South Wales grows to 180,000.

The linguist Edgar W. Schneider gives us this model for the development of Australian English:
-->
![bg right 90%](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2c/The_Founding_of_Australia._By_Capt._Arthur_Phillip_R.N._Sydney_Cove%2C_Jan._26th_1788.jpg)

1. **1788–1830s**; foundation – dialect levelling and koinéization <!-- 1788–1830. In the early years of colonization, the various dialects spoken by the early settlers and indigenous populations blend and evolve into a common dialect known as a koiné, which serves as a means of communication among the diverse groups. -->
2. **1830s–1901**; exonormative stabilization – a ‘British-plus’ identity for the English-speaking residents <!-- 1830s–1901. Anglo-Australians establish a standardized form of English that reflects external norms (that's what "exonormative" means) British norms and values. This results in the adoption of a 'British-plus' identity, where the English language in the colony is influenced by British English standards. -->
3. **1901–1942**; nativization – the emergence of local patterns <!-- During this stage, the emergence of local patterns in the English language spoken in the colony becomes more prominent. The English spoken by the residents starts to deviate from British norms and develops its own distinctive features, reflecting the local culture and identity. -->
4. **1942–1980s**; endonormative stablization – ‘Australian self-confidence’ and codification

(Burredge, 2020, p. 132)

<!-- _class: dark lead -->
(part x)

## Phonology
  <!-- Like British English, Aus English is non-rhotic, meaning the final "r" at the end of a syllable is pronounced. For example, in "HARD YAKKA", which is Aussie slang for "hard work". -->
- **Non-rhotic**
  - i.e. the final /ɹ/ phoneme at the end of a syllable is not pronounced.
  - Example: *hard yakka* &rightarrow; <span class="ipa">/hɑːd ˈjækə/</span> <audio src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/89/EN-AU_ck1_hard_yakka.ogg" controls></audio>
  <!-- Like American English, Aus English uses "flapping", or "intervocalic alveolar flapping", which is when the voiceless alveolar stop "t" phoneme in words like latter, rated, butter, instead becomes a "voiced alveolar flap" or [ɾ], "ladder", "raided", "budder" --> 
- **Intervocalic alveolar flapping**.
  - the /t/ phoneme is pronounced [ɾ]
  - e.g. *latter* &rightarrow; *ladder*; *rated* &rightarrow; *raided*; *butter* &rightarrow; "budder" <span class="ipa">/ˈbʌɾə/</span> <audio src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b2/En-au-butter_fingers.ogg" controls></audio>
  <!-- /℧/ = "FOOT", /u/ = "fruition". The "ty" in Tyuesday, and the "dy" in "dune" instead becomes "Chooseday" and "June". -->
- <span class="ipa">/tj/</span> and <span class="ipa">/dj/</span> sequences before  <span class="ipa">/℧/</span> and <span class="ipa">/u/</span> become affricates, <span class="ipa">[tʃ]</span> and <span class="ipa">[dʒ]</span>
  - e.g. Tuesday &rightarrow; "choosday" <span class="ipa">/ˈtʃuːzd(e)ɪ/</span> <audio src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d0/En-au-second_Tuesday_of_the_week.ogg" controls></audio>
  - e.g. *dune* &rightarrow; "june" <span class="ipa">/dʒuːn/</span>

## Discourse

<!-- -->
- Rising intonation on declarative sentences ("uptalk")
  - Like Californian English.
  - Falling intonation in questions.
- "Yeah, nah" (no) vs. "Nah, yeah" (yes)
  - From "[28 AUSTRALIAN SLANG Words/Phrases (That You Need to Know!)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJ8ibvD2W6U)" by Welcome To. Via YouTube. <video width="500" controls src="assets/video/yeah_nah2.mp4"></video>

## Lexis

Australian English is most known for its slang.

- **Diminutives**
  - afternoon &rightarrow; arvo
- **Loan words**
  - Very little borrowing from Indigenous languages. Mostly cultural terms (*boomerang*, *corroboree*, *waddy*), flora and fauna (*jarrah*, *kookaburra*, *mallee*) and place names.
  - Regionalisms now considered chiefly Australian:
    - From British English: *fair dinkum* 'genuine', *cobber* ‘mate’ 
    - From American English: *squatter*
